# MEDI-NLP
advanced NLP project in healthcare and data science


It is a challenge on textual inference and question entailment in the medical domain. The goal of the challenge is to develop systems that can answer questions about medical concepts based on a collection of text documents. The challenge dataset includes over 10,000 questions and answers, and the task is to develop a system that can correctly answer at least 80% of the questions.

MEDI-NLP is a challenging task because the questions are often ambiguous and the answers can be complex. However, the challenge is also very important because it can help to improve the accuracy of medical information retrieval systems.

Here are some of the benefits of this project:

It can help to improve the accuracy of medical information retrieval systems.
It can help to make medical information more accessible to patients and healthcare professionals.
It can help to improve the quality of care that patients receive.
Here are some of the challenges of this project:

The data is often noisy and unstructured.
The questions are often ambiguous.
The task is computationally expensive.
Overall, MEDI-NLP is a challenging but important project that has the potential to make a real difference in the healthcare industry.
