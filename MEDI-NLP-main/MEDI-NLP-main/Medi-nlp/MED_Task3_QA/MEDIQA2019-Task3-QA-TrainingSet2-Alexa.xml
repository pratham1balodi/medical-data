				<AnswerText>Your baby and the flu: The flu is an easily spread disease. Children under age 2 have a higher risk of developing complications if they get the flu. The information in this article has been put together to help you protect children under age 2 from the flu. This is not a substitute for medical advice from your health care provider. If you think your baby may have the flu, you should contact a health care provider right away. FLU SYMPTOMS IN INFANTS AND TODDLERS The flu is an infection of the nose, throat, and (sometimes) lungs. Call your baby’s health care provider if you notice any of the following signs: - Acting tired and cranky much of the time and not feeding well - Cough - Diarrhea and vomiting - Has a fever or feels feverish (if no thermometer available) - Runny nose HOW IS THE FLU TREATED IN BABIES? Children younger than 2 years old will often need to be treated with medicine that fights off the flu virus. This is called antiviral medicine. The medicine works best if started within 48 hours after symptoms begin, if possible. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) in liquid form will likely be used. Although this drug is not approved for use in children younger than 1 year of age, serious side effects are quite rare. After talking about the risk of side effects against the possible complications of the flu in your baby, you and your health care provider may decide to use this medicine to treat the flu. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help lower fever in children. Sometimes, your health care provider will tell you to use both types of medicine. Always check with your health care provider before giving any cold medicines to your infant or toddler. SHOULD MY BABY GET THE FLU VACCINE? All infants 6 months or older should get the flu vaccine, even if they have had a flu-like illness. The flu vaccine is not approved for children under 6 months old. - Your child will need a second flu vaccine around 4 weeks after receiving the vaccine for the first time. - There are two types of flu vaccine. One is given as a shot, and the other is sprayed into your child&apos;s nose. The flu shot contains killed (inactive) viruses. It is not possible to get the flu from this type of vaccine. The flu shot is approved for people age 6 months and older. A nasal spray-type flu vaccine uses a live, weakened virus instead of a dead one like the flu shot. It is approved for healthy children over 2 years. Anyone who lives with or has close contact with a child younger than 6 months old should also have a flu shot. WILL THE VACCINE HARM MY BABY? You or your baby can NOT get the flu from either vaccine. Some children may get a low-grade fever for a day or two after the shot. If more severe symptoms develop or they last for more than 2 days, you should call your health care provider. Some parents are afraid the vaccine could hurt their baby. But children under 2 years of age are more likely to get a severe case of the flu. It is hard to predict how ill your child may get from flu because children often have a mild illness at first. They may become sick very fast. A small amount of mercury (called thimerosal) is a common preservative in multidose vaccines. Despite concerns, thimerosal-containing vaccines have NOT been shown to cause autism, ADHD, or any other medical problems. However, all of the routine vaccines are also available without added thimerosal. Ask your health care provider if they offer this type of vaccine. HOW CAN I PREVENT MY BABY FROM GETTING THE FLU? Anyone who has flu symptoms should not care for a newborn or infant, including feeding. If a person with symptoms must care for the child, the caretaker should use a face mask and wash their hands well. Everyone who comes in close contact with your baby should do the following: - Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue away after using it. - Wash your hands often with soap and water for 15 to 20 seconds, especially after you cough or sneeze. You may also use alcohol-based hand cleaners. If your baby is younger than 6 months old and has close contact with someone with the flu, inform your health care provider. IF I HAVE FLU SYMPTOMS, CAN I BREASTFEED MY BABY? If a mother is not ill with the flu, breastfeeding is encouraged. If you are sick, you may need to express your milk for use in bottle feedings given by a healthy person. It is unlikely a newborn can catch flu from drinking your breast milk when you are sick. Breast milk is considered safe if you are taking antivirals. WHEN SHOULD I CALL THE DOCTOR? Talk to your child&apos;s health care provider or go to the emergency room if: - Your child does not act alert or more comfortable when the fever goes down. - Fever and flu symptoms come back after they have gone away. - The child does not have tears when crying. - The child&apos;s diapers are not wet, or the child has not urinated for the last 8 hours.

				<AnswerText>Swine flu (H1N1 flu): Technically, the term &quot;swine flu&quot; refers to influenza in pigs. Occasionally, pigs transmit influenza viruses to people, mainly to hog farmers and veterinarians. Less often, someone infected with swine flu passes the infection to others. The human respiratory infection caused by a particular influenza virus H1N1 strain - popularly known as swine flu - was first recognized in spring 2009. A few months after the first swine flu cases were reported, rates of confirmed H1N1-related illness were increasing in much of the world. As a result, the World Health Organization declared the infection a global pandemic. The pandemic was declared over in August 2010. Currently, H1N1 is still circulating in humans as a seasonal flu virus and protection against this strain was included in the seasonal flu vaccine for 2015-16. Another strain, H3N2 emerged in humans in 2011. H1N1 flu signs and symptoms in humans are similar to those of other flu strains: - Fever (but not always) - Cough - Sore throat - Runny or stuffy nose - Watery, red eyes - Body aches - Headache - Fatigue - Diarrhea - Nausea and vomiting H1N1 flu symptoms develop about one to three days after you&apos;re exposed to the virus. When to see a doctor It&apos;s not necessary to see a doctor if you&apos;re generally healthy and develop flu signs and symptoms, such as fever, cough and body aches. Call your doctor, however, if you have flu symptoms and you&apos;re pregnant or you have a chronic disease, such as asthma, emphysema, diabetes or a heart condition, because you have a higher risk of complications from the flu. Influenza viruses infect the cells lining your nose, throat and lungs. The virus enters your body when you inhale contaminated droplets or transfer live virus from a contaminated surface to your eyes, nose or mouth. You can&apos;t catch swine flu from eating pork. If you&apos;ve traveled to an area where many people are affected by swine flu (H1N1 flu), you may have been exposed to the virus, particularly if you spent time in large crowds. Swine farmers and veterinarians have the highest risk of true swine flu because of their exposure to pigs. Influenza complications include: - Worsening of chronic conditions, such as heart disease and asthma - Pneumonia - Neurological signs and symptoms, ranging from confusion to seizures - Respiratory failure Most cases of flu, including H1N1 flu, require only symptom relief. If you have a chronic respiratory disease, your doctor may prescribe additional medications to help relieve your symptoms. The antiviral drugs oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) are sometimes prescribed within the first day or two of symptoms to reduce the severity of your symptoms, and possibly the risk of complications. But, flu viruses can develop resistance to these drugs. To make development of resistance less likely and maintain supplies of these drugs for those who need them most, antivirals are reserved for people at high risk of complications. High-risk groups are those who: - Are in a hospital, nursing home or other long-term care facility - Are younger than 5 years of age, particularly children younger than 2 years - Are 65 years and older - Are pregnant or within two weeks of delivery, including women who have had pregnancy loss - Are younger than 19 years of age and are receiving long-term aspirin therapy, because of an increased risk of developing Reye&apos;s syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease that can occur when using aspirin during a viral illness - Are morbidly obese, defined as having a body mass index above 40 - Have certain chronic medical conditions, including asthma, emphysema, heart disease, diabetes, neuromuscular disease, or kidney, liver or blood disease - Are immunosuppressed due to certain medications or HIV - Are American Indians or Native Alaskans</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What is Flu?: Flu is a respiratory infection caused by a number of viruses. The viruses pass through the air and enter your body through your nose or mouth. Between 5% and 20% of people in the U.S. get the flu each year. The flu can be serious or even deadly for elderly people, newborn babies, and people with certain chronic illnesses. Symptoms of the flu come on suddenly and are worse than those of the common cold. They may include - Body or muscle aches - Chills - Cough - Fever - Headache - Sore throat Is it a cold or the flu? Colds rarely cause a fever or headaches. Flu almost never causes an upset stomach. And &quot;stomach flu&quot; isn&apos;t really flu at all, but gastroenteritis. Most people with the flu recover on their own without medical care. People with mild cases of the flu should stay home and avoid contact with others, except to get medical care. If you get the flu, your health care provider may prescribe medicine to help your body fight the infection and lessen symptoms. The main way to keep from getting the flu is to get a yearly flu vaccine. Good hygiene, including hand washing, can also help. NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Flu (Flu and Pneumonia): These diseases spread quickly from one person to another, and people with Alzheimer&apos;s are more likely to get them. Make sure that the person gets a flu shot each year and a pneumonia shot once after age 65. Some older people need to get more than one pneumonia vaccine. The shots lower the chances that the person will get the flu or pneumonia. For more information on pneumonia, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For more information on the flu, visit the CDC or the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Flu and pneumonia may cause:- Fever (Not everyone with pneumonia has a fever.) - Chills - Aches and pains - Vomiting - Coughing - Trouble breathing</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Pregnancy and the flu: During pregnancy, it is harder for a woman&apos;s immune system to fight infections. This makes a pregnant woman more likely to get the flu and other diseases. Pregnant women are more likely than other nonpregnant women their age to become very ill if they get the flu. If you are pregnant, you need to take special steps to stay healthy during the flu season. This article gives you information about the flu and pregnancy. It is not a substitute for medical advice from your health care provider. If you think you have the flu, you should contact your health care provider’s office immediately. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF FLU DURING PREGNANCY? Flu symptoms are the same for everyone and include: - Cough - Sore throat - Runny nose - Fever of 100°F (37.8°C) or higher Other symptoms may include body aches, headache, fatigue, vomiting, and diarrhea. SHOULD I GET THE FLU VACCINE IF I AM PREGNANT? If you are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, you should get the flu vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers pregnant women at a higher risk for getting the flu and developing flu-related complications. Pregnant women who get the flu vaccine get sick less often. They are also very unlikely to get a bad case of the flu that can harm them or their baby. Getting a mild case of the flu is often not harmful to mother or child. However, the flu vaccine can prevent the rare, severe cases of the flu that can harm mother and baby. Flu vaccines are available at most health care provider offices and health clinics. There are two types of flu vaccines: the flu shot and a nose-spray vaccine. - The flu shot is recommended for pregnant women. It contains killed (inactive) viruses. You cannot get the flu from this vaccine. - The nasal spray-type flu vaccine is not approved for pregnant women. It is OK for a pregnant woman to be around somebody who has received the nasal flu vaccine. WILL THE VACCINE HARM MY BABY? A small amount of mercury (called thimerosal) is a common preservative in multidose vaccines. Despite concerns, vaccines that contain this substance have NOT been shown to cause autism or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. If you have concerns about mercury, ask your health care provider about a preservative-free vaccine. All routine vaccines are also available without added thimerosal. The CDC says pregnant women may get flu vaccines either with or without thimerosal. WHAT ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS OF THE VACCINE? Common side effects of the flu vaccine are mild, but can include: - Redness or tenderness where the shot was given - Headache - Muscle aches - Fever - Nausea and vomiting If side effects occur, they most often begin soon after the shot. They may last as long as 1 to 2 days. If you have side effects that last longer than 2 days, you should call your doctor. HOW DO I TREAT THE FLU IF I&apos;M PREGNANT? Experts recommend treating pregnant women with flu-like illness as soon as possible after they develop symptoms. - Testing is not needed for most people. Health care providers should not wait for results of testing before treating pregnant women. - It is best to start antiviral medications within the first 48 hours of developing symptoms, but antivirals can also be used after this time period. A 75-mg capsule of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) twice per day for 5 days is the recommended first choice antiviral. WILL ANTIVIRAL MEDICATIONS HARM MY BABY? You may be worried about the medicines harming your baby. However, it is important to realize there are severe risks if you do not get treatment: - In past flu outbreaks, pregnant women who were otherwise healthy were more likely than those who were not pregnant to become very sick or even die. - This does not mean that all pregnant women will have a severe infection, but it is hard to predict who will become very ill. Women who become more ill with the flu will have mild symptoms at first. - Pregnant women can become very sick very fast, even if the symptoms are not bad at first. - Women who develop a high fever or pneumonia are at higher risk for early labor or delivery and other harm. DO I NEED AN ANTIVIRAL DRUG IF I HAVE BEEN AROUND SOMEONE WITH THE FLU? You are more likely to get the flu if you have close contact with someone who already has it. Close contact means: - Eating or drinking with the same utensils - Caring for children who are sick with the flu - Being near the droplets or secretions from someone who sneezes, coughs, or has a runny nose If you have been around someone who has the flu, ask your health care provider if you need an antiviral drug. WHAT TYPES OF COLD MEDICINE CAN I TAKE FOR THE FLU IF I&apos;M PREGNANT? Many cold medicines contain more than one type of medicine. Some may be safer than others, but none are proven 100% safe. In general, it is best to avoid cold medicines, if possible, especially during the first 3 to 4 months of pregnancy. To be safe, talk to your health care provider before taking any cold medicines while you are pregnant. WHAT ELSE CAN I DO TO PROTECT MYSELF AND MY BABY FROM THE FLU? There are many things you can do to help protect yourself and your unborn child from the flu. - You should avoid sharing food, utensils, or cups with others. - Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and throat. - Carry hand sanitizer with you, and use it often during the day.

				<AnswerText>Flu: In addition to the symptoms of Alzheimer&apos;s disease, a person with Alzheimer&apos;s may have other medical problems over time, as all older adults do. These problems can cause more confusion and behavior changes. The person may not be able to tell you what is wrong. As a caregiver, you need to watch for signs of illness and tell the doctor about what you see. Here are some common medical problems to watch for. In addition to the symptoms of Alzheimer&apos;s disease, a person with Alzheimer&apos;s may have other medical problems over time, as all older adults do. These problems can cause more confusion and behavior changes. The person may not be able to tell you what is wrong. As a caregiver, you need to watch for signs of illness and tell the doctor about what you see. Here are some common medical problems to watch for. Having a fever means that the person&apos;s temperature is 2 degrees or more above his or her normal temperature.A fever may be a sign of:- Infection, caused by germs - Dehydration, caused by a lack of fluids - Heat stroke - Constipation (discussed later in this section)Don&apos;t use a glass thermometer because the person might bite down on the glass. Use a digital thermometer, which you can buy at a grocery store or drugstore. Call the doctor right away if the person with Alzheimer&apos;s disease has a fever. These diseases spread quickly from one person to another, and people with Alzheimer&apos;s are more likely to get them. Make sure that the person gets a flu shot each year and a pneumonia shot once after age 65. Some older people need to get more than one pneumonia vaccine. The shots lower the chances that the person will get the flu or pneumonia. For more information on pneumonia, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For more information on the flu, visit the CDC or the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Flu and pneumonia may cause:- Fever (Not everyone with pneumonia has a fever.) - Chills - Aches and pains - Vomiting - Coughing - Trouble breathing As Alzheimer&apos;s disease gets worse, the person may have trouble walking and keeping his or her balance. He or she also may have changes in depth perception, which is the ability to understand distances. For example, someone with Alzheimer&apos;s may try to step down when walking from a carpeted to a tile floor. This puts him or her at risk for falls.To reduce the chance of a fall:- Clean up clutter. - Remove throw rugs. - Use chairs with arms. - Put grab bars in the bathroom. - Use good lighting. - Make sure the person wears sturdy shoes with good traction. Our bodies must have a certain amount of water to work well. If a person is sick or doesn&apos;t drink enough fluid, he or she may become dehydrated.Signs of dehydration to look for include:- Dry mouth - Dizziness - Hallucinations (Don&apos;t forget that hallucinations may be caused by Alzheimer&apos;s itself.) - Rapid heart rateBe aware of how much fluid the person is drinking. This is even more important during hot weather or in homes without air conditioning. Also, look for signs of dehydration during the winter months when heat in your home can create a lot of dry air. People can have constipation-trouble having a bowel movement-when they:- Change what they eat - Take certain medicines, including Namenda - Get less exercise than usual - Drink less fluid than usualTry to get the person to drink at least 6 glasses of liquid a day.Besides water, other good sources of liquid include:- Juice, especially prune juice - Gelatin, such as Jell-O - Soup - Milk or melted ice cream - Decaffeinated coffee and tea - Liquid cereal, such as Cream of WheatHave the person eat foods high in fiber. Foods like dried apricots, raisins, or prunes; some dry cereals; or soybeans might help ease constipation.If possible, make sure that the person gets some exercise each day, such as walking. Call the doctor if you notice a change in the person&apos;s bowel habits. Some medicines, including Alzheimer&apos;s medications, may cause diarrhea-loose bowel movements. Certain medical problems also may cause diarrhea. Make sure the person takes in lots of fluids when he or she has diarrhea. Also, be sure to let the doctor know about this problem. Incontinence means a person can&apos;t control his or her bladder and/or bowels. This may happen at any stage of Alzheimer&apos;s disease, but it is more often a problem in the later stages. Signs of this problem are leaking urine, problems emptying the bladder, and soiled underwear and bed sheets. Be sure to let the doctor know if this happens. He or she may be able to treat the cause of the problem.Here are some examples of things that can be treated:- Urinary tract infection - Enlarged prostate gland - Too little fluid in the body (dehydration) - Diabetes that isn&apos;t being treated - Taking too many water pills - Drinking too much caffeine - Taking medicines that make it hard to hold urineWhen you talk to the doctor, be ready to answer the following questions:- What medicines is the person taking? - Does the person leak urine when he or she laughs, coughs, or lifts something? - Does the person urinate often? - Can the person get to the bathroom in time? - Is the person urinating in places other than the bathroom? - Is the person soiling his or her clothes or bed sheets each night? - Do these problems happen each day or once in a while?Here are some ways you can deal with incontinence:- Remind the person to go to the bathroom every 2 to 3 hours. - Show him or her the way to the bathroom, or take him or her. - Make sure that the person wears loose, comfortable clothing that is easy to remove. - Limit fluids after 6 p.m. if problems happen at night. Do not give the person fluids with caffeine, such as coffee or tea. - Give the person fresh fruit before bedtime instead of fluids if he or she is thirsty. - Mark the bathroom door with a big sign that reads &quot;Toilet&quot; or &quot;Bathroom.&quot; - Use a stable toilet seat that is at a good height. Using a colorful toilet seat may help the person identify the toilet. You can buy raised toilet seats at medical supply stores. - Help the person when he or she needs to use a public bathroom. This may mean going into the stall with the person or using a family or private bathroom.Accidents happen. Be understanding when they occur. Stay calm and reassure the person if he or she is upset.Incontinence supplies, such as adult disposable briefs or underwear, bed protectors, and waterproof mattress covers, may be helpful. You can buy these items at drugstores and medical supply stores. A drainable pouch may be useful for the person who can&apos;t control his or her bowel movements. Talk to a nurse about how to use this product.Some people find it helpful to keep a record of how much food and fluid the person takes in and how often he or she goes to the bathroom. You can use this information to make a schedule of when he or she needs to go to the bathroom. As Alzheimer&apos;s disease gets worse, people need help taking care of their teeth or dentures.Check the person&apos;s mouth for any problems such as:- Sores - Decayed teeth - Food &quot;pocketed&quot; in the cheek or on the roof of the mouth - LumpsBe sure to take the person for dental checkups. Some people need medicine to calm them before they can see the dentist.Watch for Signs the Person Is in Pain Always remember that the person with Alzheimer&apos;s may not be able to tell you when he or she is in pain. Watch the person&apos;s face to see if it looks like he or she is in pain or feeling ill. Also, notice sudden changes in behavior such as increased yelling or striking out. If you are unsure what to do, call the doctor for help. People with Alzheimer&apos;s can have the same medical problems as many older adults. Research suggests that some of these medical problems may be related to Alzheimer&apos;s disease.For example, some heart and blood circulation problems, stroke, and diabetes are more common in people who have Alzheimer&apos;s than in the general population. Diseases caused by infections also are common. It&apos;s important that the person with Alzheimer&apos;s gets regular medical care. Make sure the person sees a health professional on a regular basis. This is the best thing you can do to help prevent medical problems.Here are some tips to help you get ready for a visit to the doctor&apos;s office:- Make an appointment during the person&apos;s best time of day and when the office is not very crowded. - Let the office staff know before the visit about the person&apos;s Alzheimer&apos;s disease. Ask them for help to make the visit go smoothly. - Don&apos;t tell the person with Alzheimer&apos;s about the visit until the day of the visit or even right before it is time to go if visiting the doctor makes the person nervous. Be positive and matter of fact. - Take something he or she likes to eat or drink and any materials or activities the person enjoys.For more information on preparing for hospital and emergency room visits, read Going to the Hospital: Tips for Dementia Caregivers.Read about this topic in Spanish.

				<AnswerText>Influenza (flu): Influenza is a viral infection that attacks your respiratory system - your nose, throat and lungs. Influenza, commonly called the flu, is not the same as stomach &quot;flu&quot; viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting. For most people, influenza resolves on its own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. People at higher risk of developing flu complications include: - Young children under 5, and especially those under 2 years - Adults older than 65 - Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities - Pregnant women and women up to two weeks postpartum - People with weakened immune systems - People who have chronic illnesses, such as asthma, heart disease, kidney disease and diabetes - People who are very obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher Your best defense against influenza is to receive an annual vaccination. Initially, the flu may seem like a common cold with a runny nose, sneezing and sore throat. But colds usually develop slowly, whereas the flu tends to come on suddenly. And although a cold can be a nuisance, you usually feel much worse with the flu. Common signs and symptoms of the flu include: - Fever over 100.4 F (38 C) - Aching muscles, especially in your back, arms and legs - Chills and sweats - Headache - Dry, persistent cough - Fatigue and weakness - Nasal congestion - Sore throat When to see a doctor Most people who get the flu can treat themselves at home and often don&apos;t need to see a doctor. If you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your doctor right away. Taking antiviral drugs within the first 48 hours after you first notice symptoms may reduce the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems. Flu viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly, or you can pick up the germs from an object - such as a telephone or computer keyboard - and then transfer them to your eyes, nose or mouth. People with the virus are likely contagious from the day or so before symptoms first appear until about five days after symptoms begin, though sometimes people are contagious for as long as 10 days after symptoms appear. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time. Influenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing regularly. If you&apos;ve had influenza in the past, your body has already made antibodies to fight that particular strain of the virus. If future influenza viruses are similar to those you&apos;ve encountered before, either by having the disease or by vaccination, those antibodies may prevent infection or lessen its severity. But antibodies against flu viruses you&apos;ve encountered in the past can&apos;t protect you from new influenza subtypes that can be very different immunologically from what you had before. Factors that may increase your risk of developing influenza or its complications include: - Age. Seasonal influenza tends to target young children and older adults. - Living or working conditions. People who live or work in facilities along with many other residents, such as nursing homes or military barracks, are more likely to develop influenza. - Weakened immune system. Cancer treatments, anti-rejection drugs, corticosteroids and HIV/AIDS can weaken your immune system. This can make it easier for you to catch influenza and may also increase your risk of developing complications. - Chronic illnesses. Chronic conditions, such as asthma, diabetes or heart problems, may increase your risk of influenza complications. - Pregnancy. Pregnant women are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters. Women who are two weeks postpartum are also more likely to develop influenza-related complications. - Obesity. People with a BMI of 40 or more have an increased risk of complications from the flu. If you&apos;re young and healthy, seasonal influenza usually isn&apos;t serious. Although you may feel miserable while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects. But high-risk children and adults may develop complications such as: - Pneumonia - Bronchitis - Asthma flare-ups - Heart problems - Ear infections Pneumonia is the most serious complication. For older adults and people with a chronic illness, pneumonia can be deadly. Your doctor will conduct a physical exam, look for signs and symptoms of influenza, and possibly order a test that detects influenza viruses. The most commonly used test is called a rapid influenza diagnostics test, which looks for substances (antigens) on a swab sample from the back of the nose or throat. These tests can provide results in 30 minutes or less. However, results vary greatly and are not always accurate. Your doctor may diagnose you with influenza based on symptoms, despite having a negative test result. More-sensitive flu tests are available in some specialized hospitals and labs. Usually, you&apos;ll need nothing more than bed rest and plenty of fluids to treat the flu. But in some cases, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medication, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza). If taken soon after you notice symptoms, these drugs may shorten your illness by a day or so and help prevent serious complications. Oseltamivir is an oral medication. Zanamivir is inhaled through a device similar to an asthma inhaler and shouldn&apos;t be used by anyone with respiratory problems, such as asthma and lung disease. Antiviral medication side effects may include nausea and vomiting. These side effects may be lessened if the drug is taken with food. Oseltamivir has also been associated with delirium and self-harm behaviors in teenagers. Some researchers recommend further study on both of these drugs because of uncertainty about their effects beyond a slight reduction in the time of illness. Some studies have suggested that these medications can also help reduce the severity of complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still recommends their use for some people. An additional concern is that some strains of influenza have become resistant to oseltamivir, amantadine and rimantadine (Flumadine), which are older antiviral drugs.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>College students and the flu: Every year, the flu spreads across college campuses nationwide. Close living quarters, shared restrooms, and a lot of social activities make a college student more likely to catch the flu. This article will give you information about the flu and college students. This is not a substitute for medical advice from your health care provider. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF THE FLU? A college student with the flu will most often have a fever of 100°F (37.8°C) or higher, and a sore throat or a cough. Other symptoms may include: - Chills - Headache - Sore muscles - Runny nose - Fatigue - Diarrhea and vomiting Most people with milder symptoms should feel better within 3 to 4 days and do not need to see a health care provider. Avoid contact with other people and drink plenty of fluids if you are having flu symptoms. HOW DO I TREAT MY SYMPTOMS? Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help lower fever. Check with your health care provider before taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen if you have liver disease. - Take acetaminophen every 4 to 6 hours as directed. - Take ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours as directed. - Do NOT use aspirin. A fever does not need to come all the way down to normal. Most people will feel better if their temperature drops by one degree. Over-the-counter cold medicines may relieve some symptoms. Throat lozenges or sprays that contain an anesthetic will help with a sore throat. Check your student health center&apos;s web site for more information. WHAT ABOUT ANTIVIRAL MEDICINES? Most people with milder symptoms feel better within 3 to 4 days and do not need to take antiviral medicines. Ask your health care provider if antiviral medicine is right for you. If you have any of the medical conditions below, you may be at risk for a more severe case of the flu: - Lung disease (including asthma) - Heart conditions (except high blood pressure) - Kidney, liver, nerve, and muscle conditions - Blood disorders (including sickle cell disease) - Diabetes and other metabolic disorders - A weakened immune system due to diseases (such as AIDS), radiation therapy, or certain medications, including chemotherapy and corticosteroids - Other long-term (chronic) medical problems Antiviral medicines such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) are used to treat some people who have the flu. These drugs work better if you start taking them within 2 days of your first symptoms. WHEN CAN I RETURN TO SCHOOL? You should be able to return to school when you&apos;re feeling well and have not had a fever for 24 hours (without taking acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or other medicines to lower your fever). SHOULD I GET THE FLU VACCINE? People should get the vaccine even if they&apos;ve had a flu-like illness already. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older should receive the flu vaccine. Receiving the flu vaccine will help protect you from getting the flu. WHERE CAN I GET A FLU VACCINE? Flu vaccines are often available at local health centers, health care provider&apos;s offices, and pharmacies. Ask your student health center, health care provider, pharmacy, or your place of work if they offer the flu vaccine. HOW DO I AVOID CATCHING OR SPREADING FLU? - Stay in your apartment, dorm room, or home for at least 24 hours after your fever goes away. Wear a mask if you leave your room. - Do NOT share food, utensils, cups, or bottles. - Cover your mouth with a tissue when coughing and throw it away after use. - Cough into your sleeve if a tissue is not available. - Carry alcohol-based hand sanitizer with you. Use it often during the day and always after touching your face. - Do NOT touch your eyes, nose, and mouth. WHEN SHOULD I SEE A DOCTOR? Most college students do not need to see a health care provider when they have mild flu symptoms. This is because most college-age people are not at risk for a severe case. If you feel you should see a health care provider, call the office first and tell them your symptoms. This helps the staff prepare for your visit, so that you do not spread germs to other people there. If you have an increased risk of flu complications, contact your health care provider. Risk factors include: - Chronic lung problems (including asthma or COPD) - Heart problems (except high blood pressure) - Kidney disease or failure (long-term) - Liver disease (long-term) - Brain or nervous system disorder - Blood disorders (including sickle cell disease) - Diabetes and other metabolic disorders - Weak immune system (such as people with AIDS, cancer, or an organ transplant; receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy; or taking corticosteroid pills every day) You may also want to talk to your health care provider if you are around others who may be at risk for a severe case of the flu, including people who: - Live with or care for a child 6 months old or younger - Work in a health care setting and have direct contact with patients - Live with or care for someone with a chronic medical problem who has not been vaccinated for the flu Call your health care provider right away or go to the emergency room if you have: - Difficulty breathing, or shortness of breath - Chest pain or abdominal pain - Sudden dizziness - Confusion, or problems reasoning - Severe vomiting, or vomiting that does not go away - Flu-like symptoms improve, but then return with a fever and worse cough Updated by: Laura J.

				<AnswerText>H1N1 influenza (Swine flu): The H1N1 virus (swine flu) is an infection of the nose, throat, and lungs. It is caused by the H1N1 influenza virus. Earlier forms of the H1N1 virus were found in pigs (swine). Over time, the virus changed (mutated) and infected humans. H1N1 is a new virus first detected in humans in 2009. It spread quickly around the world. The H1N1 virus is one of the three viruses included in the regular (seasonal) flu vaccine. You cannot get H1N1 flu virus from eating pork or any other food, drinking water, swimming in pools, or using hot tubs or saunas. Any flu virus can spread from person to person when: - Someone with the flu coughs or sneezes into air that others breathe in. - Someone touches a doorknob, desk, computer, or counter with the flu virus on it and then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose. - Someone touches mucus while taking care of a child or adult who is ill with the flu.

				<AnswerText>Your baby and the flu (Information): FLU SYMPTOMS IN INFANTS AND TODDLERS The flu is an infection of the nose, throat, and (sometimes) lungs. Call your baby’s health care provider if you notice any of the following signs: - Acting tired and cranky much of the time and not feeding well - Cough - Diarrhea and vomiting - Has a fever or feels feverish (if no thermometer available) - Runny nose HOW IS THE FLU TREATED IN BABIES? Children younger than 2 years old will often need to be treated with medicine that fights off the flu virus. This is called antiviral medicine. The medicine works best if started within 48 hours after symptoms begin, if possible. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) in liquid form will likely be used. Although this drug is not approved for use in children younger than 1 year of age, serious side effects are quite rare. After talking about the risk of side effects against the possible complications of the flu in your baby, you and your health care provider may decide to use this medicine to treat the flu. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help lower fever in children. Sometimes, your health care provider will tell you to use both types of medicine. Always check with your health care provider before giving any cold medicines to your infant or toddler. SHOULD MY BABY GET THE FLU VACCINE? All infants 6 months or older should get the flu vaccine, even if they have had a flu-like illness. The flu vaccine is not approved for children under 6 months old. - Your child will need a second flu vaccine around 4 weeks after receiving the vaccine for the first time. - There are two types of flu vaccine. One is given as a shot, and the other is sprayed into your child&apos;s nose. The flu shot contains killed (inactive) viruses. It is not possible to get the flu from this type of vaccine. The flu shot is approved for people age 6 months and older. A nasal spray-type flu vaccine uses a live, weakened virus instead of a dead one like the flu shot. It is approved for healthy children over 2 years. Anyone who lives with or has close contact with a child younger than 6 months old should also have a flu shot. WILL THE VACCINE HARM MY BABY? You or your baby can NOT get the flu from either vaccine. Some children may get a low-grade fever for a day or two after the shot. If more severe symptoms develop or they last for more than 2 days, you should call your health care provider. Some parents are afraid the vaccine could hurt their baby. But children under 2 years of age are more likely to get a severe case of the flu. It is hard to predict how ill your child may get from flu because children often have a mild illness at first. They may become sick very fast. A small amount of mercury (called thimerosal) is a common preservative in multidose vaccines. Despite concerns, thimerosal-containing vaccines have NOT been shown to cause autism, ADHD, or any other medical problems. However, all of the routine vaccines are also available without added thimerosal. Ask your health care provider if they offer this type of vaccine. HOW CAN I PREVENT MY BABY FROM GETTING THE FLU? Anyone who has flu symptoms should not care for a newborn or infant, including feeding. If a person with symptoms must care for the child, the caretaker should use a face mask and wash their hands well. Everyone who comes in close contact with your baby should do the following: - Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue away after using it. - Wash your hands often with soap and water for 15 to 20 seconds, especially after you cough or sneeze. You may also use alcohol-based hand cleaners. If your baby is younger than 6 months old and has close contact with someone with the flu, inform your health care provider. IF I HAVE FLU SYMPTOMS, CAN I BREASTFEED MY BABY? If a mother is not ill with the flu, breastfeeding is encouraged. If you are sick, you may need to express your milk for use in bottle feedings given by a healthy person. It is unlikely a newborn can catch flu from drinking your breast milk when you are sick. Breast milk is considered safe if you are taking antivirals. WHEN SHOULD I CALL THE DOCTOR? Talk to your child&apos;s health care provider or go to the emergency room if: - Your child does not act alert or more comfortable when the fever goes down. - Fever and flu symptoms come back after they have gone away. - The child does not have tears when crying. - The child&apos;s diapers are not wet, or the child has not urinated for the last 8 hours.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What causes Flu?: The flu is caused by an influenza virus. Most people get the flu when they breathe in tiny airborne droplets from the coughs or sneezes of someone who has the flu. You can also catch the flu if you touch something with the virus on it, and then touch your mouth, nose, or eyes. People often confuse colds and flu. They are different, but you might have some of the same symptoms. Most people get a cold several times a year. On the contrary, people get the flu only once every few years. Sometimes, you can get a virus that makes you throw up or have diarrhea. Some people call this the &quot;stomach flu.&quot; This is a misleading name because this virus is not the actual flu. The flu mostly affects your nose, throat, and lungs.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Flu Shot (Summary): Summary Flu is a respiratory infection caused by a number of viruses. Most people with the flu get better on their own. But it can be serious. It can cause complications and sometimes even death. Getting the flu vaccine every year is the best way to lower your chance of getting the flu and spreading it to others. The flu vaccine causes antibodies to develop in your body about two weeks after you get it. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the viruses that are in the vaccine. There are different types of flu shots, including some especially for people 65 and older. Ask your health care provider which one is right for you. Everyone 6 months of age and older should get a flu vaccine every season. People with egg allergies should check with their doctors before getting a vaccine. Other exceptions are people who have - Had reactions to flu shots before - Guillain-Barre Syndrome - A fever Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Swine flu (H1N1 flu): Technically, the term &quot;swine flu&quot; refers to influenza in pigs. Occasionally, pigs transmit influenza viruses to people, mainly to hog farmers and veterinarians. Less often, someone infected with swine flu passes the infection to others. The human respiratory infection caused by a particular influenza virus H1N1 strain - popularly known as swine flu - was first recognized in spring 2009. A few months after the first swine flu cases were reported, rates of confirmed H1N1-related illness were increasing in much of the world. As a result, the World Health Organization declared the infection a global pandemic. The pandemic was declared over in August 2010. Currently, H1N1 is still circulating in humans as a seasonal flu virus and protection against this strain was included in the seasonal flu vaccine for 2015-16. Another strain, H3N2 emerged in humans in 2011. H1N1 flu signs and symptoms in humans are similar to those of other flu strains: - Fever (but not always) - Cough - Sore throat - Runny or stuffy nose - Watery, red eyes - Body aches - Headache - Fatigue - Diarrhea - Nausea and vomiting H1N1 flu symptoms develop about one to three days after you&apos;re exposed to the virus. When to see a doctor It&apos;s not necessary to see a doctor if you&apos;re generally healthy and develop flu signs and symptoms, such as fever, cough and body aches. Call your doctor, however, if you have flu symptoms and you&apos;re pregnant or you have a chronic disease, such as asthma, emphysema, diabetes or a heart condition, because you have a higher risk of complications from the flu. Influenza viruses infect the cells lining your nose, throat and lungs. The virus enters your body when you inhale contaminated droplets or transfer live virus from a contaminated surface to your eyes, nose or mouth. You can&apos;t catch swine flu from eating pork. If you&apos;ve traveled to an area where many people are affected by swine flu (H1N1 flu), you may have been exposed to the virus, particularly if you spent time in large crowds. Swine farmers and veterinarians have the highest risk of true swine flu because of their exposure to pigs. Influenza complications include: - Worsening of chronic conditions, such as heart disease and asthma - Pneumonia - Neurological signs and symptoms, ranging from confusion to seizures - Respiratory failure Most cases of flu, including H1N1 flu, require only symptom relief. If you have a chronic respiratory disease, your doctor may prescribe additional medications to help relieve your symptoms. The antiviral drugs oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) are sometimes prescribed within the first day or two of symptoms to reduce the severity of your symptoms, and possibly the risk of complications. But, flu viruses can develop resistance to these drugs. To make development of resistance less likely and maintain supplies of these drugs for those who need them most, antivirals are reserved for people at high risk of complications. High-risk groups are those who: - Are in a hospital, nursing home or other long-term care facility - Are younger than 5 years of age, particularly children younger than 2 years - Are 65 years and older - Are pregnant or within two weeks of delivery, including women who have had pregnancy loss - Are younger than 19 years of age and are receiving long-term aspirin therapy, because of an increased risk of developing Reye&apos;s syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease that can occur when using aspirin during a viral illness - Are morbidly obese, defined as having a body mass index above 40 - Have certain chronic medical conditions, including asthma, emphysema, heart disease, diabetes, neuromuscular disease, or kidney, liver or blood disease - Are immunosuppressed due to certain medications or HIV - Are American Indians or Native Alaskans</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What are the symptoms of Flu?: Flu symptoms will often start quickly. You can start to feel sick about 1 to 7 days after you come in contact with the virus. Most of the time symptoms appear within 2 to 3 days. The flu spreads easily. It can affect a large group of people in a very short amount of time. For example, students and co-workers get sick within 2 or 3 weeks of the flu&apos;s arrival in a school or workplace. The first symptom is a fever between 102F (38C) and 106F (41.1C). An adult often has a lower fever than a child. Other common symptoms include: - Body aches - Chills - Dizziness - Flushed face - Headache - Lack of energy - Nausea and vomiting The fever, aches, and pains begin to go away on days 2 through 4. But new symptoms occur, including: - Dry cough - Increased symptoms that affect breathing - Runny nose (clear and watery) - Sneezing - Sore throat Most symptoms go away in 4 to 7 days. The cough and tired feeling may last for weeks. Sometimes, the fever comes back. Some people may not feel like eating. The flu can make asthma, breathing problems, and other long-term (chronic) illnesses and conditions worse.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Headaches - danger signs: A headache is a pain or discomfort in the head, scalp, or neck. Common types of headaches include tension headaches, migraine or cluster headaches, sinus headaches, and headaches that begin in your neck. You may have a mild headache with a cold, the flu, or other viral illnesses when you also have a low fever. Most people with headaches feel better by making lifestyle changes, such as learning ways to relax. Taking certain medicines, such as pain medicine, may also help. Problems with blood vessels and bleeding in the brain can cause a headache. These problems include: - Abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in the brain that usually forms before birth. This problem is called an arteriovenous malformation, or AVM. - Blood flow to part of the brain stops.

				<AnswerText>Myopathy with extrapyramidal signs: Myopathy with extrapyramidal signs is a disorder characterized by early childhood onset of proximal muscle weakness (muscles closest to the body’s midline) and learning disabilities. The muscle weakness does not progress, but most patients develop progressive atypical involuntary muscle contractions that influence gait, movement, and posture (extrapyramidal signs) that may be disabling. Signs and symptoms are variable and include brief, repetitive, jerky and uncontrolled movements caused by muscle contractions ( chorea), tremor, abnormal posturing, and involuntary repetitive movements of the mouth and face. [1]  Other symptoms may include uncoordinated movements ( ataxia ), a very small head ( microcephaly ), drooping of the eyelids, wasting of the eye nerve ( optic atrophy), and axonal peripheral neuropathy. It is caused by changes ( mutations ) in the MICU1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive   pattern. [1] [2] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below.

				<AnswerText>Warning signs and symptoms of heart disease: Heart disease often develops over time. You may have early signs or symptoms long before you have serious heart problems. Or you may not realize you are developing heart disease. The warning signs of heart disease may not be obvious. Also, not every person has the same symptoms. Certain symptoms, such as chest pain, ankle swelling, and shortness of breath may be signals that something is wrong. Learning the warning signs can help you get treatment and help prevent a heart attack or stroke. Chest pain is discomfort or pain that you feel along the front of your body, between your neck and upper abdomen. There are many causes of chest pain that have nothing to do with your heart. But chest pain is still the most common symptom of poor blood flow to the heart or a heart attack. This type of chest pain is called angina. Chest pain can occur when the heart is not getting enough blood or oxygen. The amount and type of pain can vary from person to person. The intensity of the pain does not always relate to how severe the problem is. - Some people may feel a crushing pain, while others feel only mild discomfort. - Your chest may feel heavy or like someone is squeezing your heart. You may also feel a sharp, burning pain in your chest. - You may feel the pain under your breastbone (sternum), or in your neck, arms, stomach, jaw, or upper back. - Chest pain from angina often occurs with activity or emotion, and goes away with rest or a medicine called nitroglycerin. - Bad indigestion can also cause chest pain. Women, older adults, and people with diabetes may have little or no chest pain. They are more likely to have symptoms other than chest pain, such as: - Fatigue - Shortness of breath - General weakness - Change in skin color or greyish pallor (episodes of change in skin color associated with weakness) Other symptoms of a heart attack can include: - Extreme anxiety - Fainting or loss of consciousness - Lightheadedness or dizziness - Nausea or vomiting - Palpitations (feeling like your heart is beating too fast or irregularly) - Shortness of breath - Sweating, which may be very heavy When the heart can&apos;t pump blood as well as it should, blood backs up in the veins that go from the lungs to the heart. Fluid leaks into the lungs and causes shortness of breath. This is a symptom of heart failure. You may notice shortness of breath: - During activity - While you&apos;re resting - When you&apos;re lying flat on your back -- it may even wake you from sleep Coughing or wheezing that doesn&apos;t go away can be another sign that fluid is building up in your lungs. You may also cough up mucus that is pink or bloody. Swelling (edema) in your lower legs is another sign of a heart problem. When your heart doesn&apos;t work as well, blood flow slows and backs up in the veins in your legs. This causes fluid to build up in your tissues. You may also have swelling in your stomach or notice some weight gain. Narrowing of the blood vessels that bring blood to other parts of the body may mean you have a much higher risk for heart attack. It can occur when cholesterol and other fatty material (plaque) build up on the walls of your arteries. Poor blood supply to the legs may lead to: - Pain, achiness, fatigue, burning, or discomfort in the muscles of your feet, calves, or thighs. - Symptoms that often appear during walking or exercise, and go away after several minutes of rest. - Numbness in your legs or feet when you are at rest. Your legs may also feel cool to the touch, and the skin may look pale. A stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain stops. A stroke is sometimes called a &quot;brain attack.&quot; Symptoms of stroke can include difficulty moving the limbs on one side of your body, one side of the face drooping, difficulty with speaking or understanding language. Tiredness can have many causes. Often it simply means that you need more rest. But feeling run down can be a sign of a more serious problem. Fatigue may be a sign of heart trouble when: - You feel much more tired than normal. It&apos;s common for women to feel severely tired before or during a heart attack. - You feel so tired that you can&apos;t do your normal daily activities. - You have sudden, severe weakness. If your heart can&apos;t pump blood as well, it may beat faster to try to keep up. You may feel your heart racing or throbbing. A fast or uneven heartbeat can also be the sign of an arrhythmia. This is a problem with your heart rate or rhythm. If you have any signs of heart disease, call your health care provider right away. Don&apos;t wait to see if the symptoms go away or dismiss them as nothing. Call your local emergency number (such as 911) if: - You have chest pain or other symptoms of a heart attack - If you know you have angina and have chest pain that doesn&apos;t go away after 5 minutes of rest or after taking nitroglycerine - If you think you may be having a heart attack - If you become extremely short of breath - If you think you may have lost consciousness Updated by: Michael A.

				<AnswerURL>https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/swine-flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20378103</AnswerURL>
				<AnswerText>Swine flu (H1N1 flu) (Treatment): Most cases of flu, including H1N1 flu, require only symptom relief. If you have a chronic respiratory disease, your doctor may prescribe additional medications to help relieve your symptoms. The antiviral drugs oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) are sometimes prescribed within the first day or two of symptoms to reduce the severity of your symptoms, and possibly the risk of complications. But, flu viruses can develop resistance to these drugs. To make development of resistance less likely and maintain supplies of these drugs for those who need them most, antivirals are reserved for people at high risk of complications. High-risk groups are those who: - Are in a hospital, nursing home or other long-term care facility - Are younger than 5 years of age, particularly children younger than 2 years - Are 65 years and older - Are pregnant or within two weeks of delivery, including women who have had pregnancy loss - Are younger than 19 years of age and are receiving long-term aspirin therapy, because of an increased risk of developing Reye&apos;s syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease that can occur when using aspirin during a viral illness - Are morbidly obese, defined as having a body mass index above 40 - Have certain chronic medical conditions, including asthma, emphysema, heart disease, diabetes, neuromuscular disease, or kidney, liver or blood disease - Are immunosuppressed due to certain medications or HIV - Are American Indians or Native Alaskans</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What are the treatments for Flu?: HOME CARE Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help lower fever. Providers sometimes suggest you to use both types of medicine. DO NOT use aspirin. A fever does not need to come all the way down to normal. Most people feel better when the temperature drops by 1 degree. Over-the-counter cold medicines may make some of your symptoms better. Cough drops or throat sprays will help with your sore throat. You will need a lot of rest. Drink plenty of liquids. DO NOT smoke or drink alcohol. ANTIVIRAL DRUGS Most people with milder symptoms feel better in 3 to 4 days. They do not need to see a provider or take antiviral medicines. Providers may give antiviral drugs to people who get very sick with the flu. You may need these medicines if you are more likely to have flu complications The health problems below may increase your risk of getting sicker with the flu: - Lung disease (including asthma) - Heart conditions (except high blood pressure) - Kidney, liver, nerve, and muscle conditions - Blood disorders (including sickle cell disease) - Diabetes - A weakened immune system due to diseases (such as AIDS), radiation therapy, or certain medicines, including chemotherapy and corticosteroids - Other long-term medical problem These medicines may shorten the time you have symptoms by about 1 day. They work better if you start taking them within 2 days of your first symptoms. Children at risk of a severe case of the flu may also need these medicines.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Influenza (flu) (Treatment): Usually, you&apos;ll need nothing more than bed rest and plenty of fluids to treat the flu. But in some cases, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medication, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza). If taken soon after you notice symptoms, these drugs may shorten your illness by a day or so and help prevent serious complications. Oseltamivir is an oral medication. Zanamivir is inhaled through a device similar to an asthma inhaler and shouldn&apos;t be used by anyone with respiratory problems, such as asthma and lung disease. Antiviral medication side effects may include nausea and vomiting. These side effects may be lessened if the drug is taken with food. Oseltamivir has also been associated with delirium and self-harm behaviors in teenagers. Some researchers recommend further study on both of these drugs because of uncertainty about their effects beyond a slight reduction in the time of illness. Some studies have suggested that these medications can also help reduce the severity of complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still recommends their use for some people. An additional concern is that some strains of influenza have become resistant to oseltamivir, amantadine and rimantadine (Flumadine), which are older antiviral drugs.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerURL>https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/insulin-medicines-treatments</AnswerURL>
				<AnswerText>Insulin, Medicines, and Other Diabetes Treatments (Do I have other treatment options for my diabetes?): When medicines and lifestyle changes are not enough to manage your diabetes, a less common treatment may be an option. Other treatments include bariatric surgery for certain people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and an &quot;artificial pancreas&quot; and pancreatic islet transplantation for some people with type 1 diabetes.Bariatric surgeryAlso called weight-loss surgery or metabolic surgery, bariatric surgery may help some people with obesity and type 2 diabetes lose a large amount of weight and regain normal blood glucose levels. Some people with diabetes may no longer need their diabetes medicine after bariatric surgery. Whether and for how long blood glucose levels improve seems to vary by the patient, type of weight-loss surgery, and amount of weight the person loses. Other factors include how long someone has had diabetes and whether or not the person uses insulin.1Recent research suggests that weight-loss surgery also may help improve blood glucose control in people with type 1 diabetes who are obese.2Researchers are studying the long-term results of bariatric surgery in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.Artificial PancreasThe NIDDK has played an important role in developing “artificial pancreas” technology. An artificial pancreas replaces manual blood glucose testing and the use of insulin shots or a pump. A single system monitors blood glucose levels around the clock and provides insulin or a combination of insulin and a second hormone, glucagon, automatically. The system can also be monitored remotely, for example by parents or medical staff.In 2016, the FDA approved a type of artificial pancreas system called a hybrid closed-loop system. This system tests your glucose level every 5 minutes throughout the day and night, and automatically gives you the right amount of insulin.You still need to manually adjust the amount of insulin the pump delivers at mealtimes. But, the artificial pancreas may free you from some of the daily tasks needed to keep your blood glucose stable—or help you sleep through the night without the need to wake and test your glucose or take medicine.The hybrid closed-loop system is expected to be available in the U.S. in 2017. Talk with your health care provider about whether this system might be right for you.The NIDDK has funded several important studies on different types of artificial pancreas devices to better help people with type 1 diabetes manage their disease. The devices may also help people with type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes.Pancreatic islet transplantationPancreatic islet transplantation is an experimental treatment for poorly controlled type 1 diabetes. Pancreatic islets are clusters of cells in the pancreas that make the hormone insulin. In type 1 diabetes, the body’s immune system attacks these cells. A pancreatic islet transplant replaces destroyed islets with new ones that make and release insulin. This procedure takes islets from the pancreas of an organ donor and transfers them to a person with type 1 diabetes. Because researchers are still studying pancreatic islet transplantation, the procedure is only available to people enrolled in research studies.

				<AnswerText>Avian influenza (Treatment): Treatment varies, and is based on your symptoms. In general, treatment with the antiviral medicine oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza) may make the disease less severe. For the medicine to work, you need to start taking it within 48 hours after your symptoms start. Oseltamivir may also be prescribed for people who live in the same house people with avian flu. This may prevent them from getting the illness. The virus that causes human avian flu is resistant to the antiviral medicines amantadine and rimantadine. These medicines should not be used in the case of an H5N1 outbreak. People with severe infection may need to be placed on a breathing machine. People infected with the virus also should be kept separate from non-infected people. Providers recommend that people get an influenza (flu) shot. This may cut down the chance that the avian flu virus will mix with a human flu virus. This might create a new virus that may easily spread.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Your baby and the flu (Information): FLU SYMPTOMS IN INFANTS AND TODDLERS The flu is an infection of the nose, throat, and (sometimes) lungs. Call your baby’s health care provider if you notice any of the following signs: - Acting tired and cranky much of the time and not feeding well - Cough - Diarrhea and vomiting - Has a fever or feels feverish (if no thermometer available) - Runny nose HOW IS THE FLU TREATED IN BABIES? Children younger than 2 years old will often need to be treated with medicine that fights off the flu virus. This is called antiviral medicine. The medicine works best if started within 48 hours after symptoms begin, if possible. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) in liquid form will likely be used. Although this drug is not approved for use in children younger than 1 year of age, serious side effects are quite rare. After talking about the risk of side effects against the possible complications of the flu in your baby, you and your health care provider may decide to use this medicine to treat the flu. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help lower fever in children. Sometimes, your health care provider will tell you to use both types of medicine. Always check with your health care provider before giving any cold medicines to your infant or toddler. SHOULD MY BABY GET THE FLU VACCINE? All infants 6 months or older should get the flu vaccine, even if they have had a flu-like illness. The flu vaccine is not approved for children under 6 months old. - Your child will need a second flu vaccine around 4 weeks after receiving the vaccine for the first time. - There are two types of flu vaccine. One is given as a shot, and the other is sprayed into your child&apos;s nose. The flu shot contains killed (inactive) viruses. It is not possible to get the flu from this type of vaccine. The flu shot is approved for people age 6 months and older. A nasal spray-type flu vaccine uses a live, weakened virus instead of a dead one like the flu shot. It is approved for healthy children over 2 years. Anyone who lives with or has close contact with a child younger than 6 months old should also have a flu shot. WILL THE VACCINE HARM MY BABY? You or your baby can NOT get the flu from either vaccine. Some children may get a low-grade fever for a day or two after the shot. If more severe symptoms develop or they last for more than 2 days, you should call your health care provider. Some parents are afraid the vaccine could hurt their baby. But children under 2 years of age are more likely to get a severe case of the flu. It is hard to predict how ill your child may get from flu because children often have a mild illness at first. They may become sick very fast. A small amount of mercury (called thimerosal) is a common preservative in multidose vaccines. Despite concerns, thimerosal-containing vaccines have NOT been shown to cause autism, ADHD, or any other medical problems. However, all of the routine vaccines are also available without added thimerosal. Ask your health care provider if they offer this type of vaccine. HOW CAN I PREVENT MY BABY FROM GETTING THE FLU? Anyone who has flu symptoms should not care for a newborn or infant, including feeding. If a person with symptoms must care for the child, the caretaker should use a face mask and wash their hands well. Everyone who comes in close contact with your baby should do the following: - Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue away after using it. - Wash your hands often with soap and water for 15 to 20 seconds, especially after you cough or sneeze. You may also use alcohol-based hand cleaners. If your baby is younger than 6 months old and has close contact with someone with the flu, inform your health care provider. IF I HAVE FLU SYMPTOMS, CAN I BREASTFEED MY BABY? If a mother is not ill with the flu, breastfeeding is encouraged. If you are sick, you may need to express your milk for use in bottle feedings given by a healthy person. It is unlikely a newborn can catch flu from drinking your breast milk when you are sick. Breast milk is considered safe if you are taking antivirals. WHEN SHOULD I CALL THE DOCTOR? Talk to your child&apos;s health care provider or go to the emergency room if: - Your child does not act alert or more comfortable when the fever goes down. - Fever and flu symptoms come back after they have gone away. - The child does not have tears when crying. - The child&apos;s diapers are not wet, or the child has not urinated for the last 8 hours.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>How to diagnose Flu?: Most people do not need to see a health care provider when they have flu symptoms. This is because most people are not at risk for a severe case of the flu. If you are very sick with the flu, you may want to see your provider. People who are at high risk for flu complications may also want to see a provider if they get the flu. When many people in an area have flu, a provider can make a diagnosis after hearing about your symptoms. No further testing is needed. There is a test to detect the flu. It is done by swabbing the nose or throat. Most of the time, test results are available very fast. The test can help your provider prescribe the best treatment.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Your baby and the flu (Information): FLU SYMPTOMS IN INFANTS AND TODDLERS The flu is an infection of the nose, throat, and (sometimes) lungs. Call your baby’s health care provider if you notice any of the following signs: - Acting tired and cranky much of the time and not feeding well - Cough - Diarrhea and vomiting - Has a fever or feels feverish (if no thermometer available) - Runny nose HOW IS THE FLU TREATED IN BABIES? Children younger than 2 years old will often need to be treated with medicine that fights off the flu virus. This is called antiviral medicine. The medicine works best if started within 48 hours after symptoms begin, if possible. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) in liquid form will likely be used. Although this drug is not approved for use in children younger than 1 year of age, serious side effects are quite rare. After talking about the risk of side effects against the possible complications of the flu in your baby, you and your health care provider may decide to use this medicine to treat the flu. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help lower fever in children. Sometimes, your health care provider will tell you to use both types of medicine. Always check with your health care provider before giving any cold medicines to your infant or toddler. SHOULD MY BABY GET THE FLU VACCINE? All infants 6 months or older should get the flu vaccine, even if they have had a flu-like illness. The flu vaccine is not approved for children under 6 months old. - Your child will need a second flu vaccine around 4 weeks after receiving the vaccine for the first time. - There are two types of flu vaccine. One is given as a shot, and the other is sprayed into your child&apos;s nose. The flu shot contains killed (inactive) viruses. It is not possible to get the flu from this type of vaccine. The flu shot is approved for people age 6 months and older. A nasal spray-type flu vaccine uses a live, weakened virus instead of a dead one like the flu shot. It is approved for healthy children over 2 years. Anyone who lives with or has close contact with a child younger than 6 months old should also have a flu shot. WILL THE VACCINE HARM MY BABY? You or your baby can NOT get the flu from either vaccine. Some children may get a low-grade fever for a day or two after the shot. If more severe symptoms develop or they last for more than 2 days, you should call your health care provider. Some parents are afraid the vaccine could hurt their baby. But children under 2 years of age are more likely to get a severe case of the flu. It is hard to predict how ill your child may get from flu because children often have a mild illness at first. They may become sick very fast. A small amount of mercury (called thimerosal) is a common preservative in multidose vaccines. Despite concerns, thimerosal-containing vaccines have NOT been shown to cause autism, ADHD, or any other medical problems. However, all of the routine vaccines are also available without added thimerosal. Ask your health care provider if they offer this type of vaccine. HOW CAN I PREVENT MY BABY FROM GETTING THE FLU? Anyone who has flu symptoms should not care for a newborn or infant, including feeding. If a person with symptoms must care for the child, the caretaker should use a face mask and wash their hands well. Everyone who comes in close contact with your baby should do the following: - Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue away after using it. - Wash your hands often with soap and water for 15 to 20 seconds, especially after you cough or sneeze. You may also use alcohol-based hand cleaners. If your baby is younger than 6 months old and has close contact with someone with the flu, inform your health care provider. IF I HAVE FLU SYMPTOMS, CAN I BREASTFEED MY BABY? If a mother is not ill with the flu, breastfeeding is encouraged. If you are sick, you may need to express your milk for use in bottle feedings given by a healthy person. It is unlikely a newborn can catch flu from drinking your breast milk when you are sick. Breast milk is considered safe if you are taking antivirals. WHEN SHOULD I CALL THE DOCTOR? Talk to your child&apos;s health care provider or go to the emergency room if: - Your child does not act alert or more comfortable when the fever goes down. - Fever and flu symptoms come back after they have gone away. - The child does not have tears when crying. - The child&apos;s diapers are not wet, or the child has not urinated for the last 8 hours.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Flu: The flu is an infection of the nose, throat, and lungs. It spreads easily. This article discusses influenza types A and B. Another type of the flu is the swine flu (H1N1). The flu is caused by an influenza virus. Most people get the flu when they breathe in tiny airborne droplets from the coughs or sneezes of someone who has the flu. You can also catch the flu if you touch something with the virus on it, and then touch your mouth, nose, or eyes. People often confuse colds and flu. They are different, but you might have some of the same symptoms. Most people get a cold several times a year. On the contrary, people get the flu only once every few years. Sometimes, you can get a virus that makes you throw up or have diarrhea. Some people call this the &quot;stomach flu.&quot; This is a misleading name because this virus is not the actual flu. The flu mostly affects your nose, throat, and lungs. Flu symptoms will often start quickly. You can start to feel sick about 1 to 7 days after you come in contact with the virus. Most of the time symptoms appear within 2 to 3 days. The flu spreads easily. It can affect a large group of people in a very short amount of time. For example, students and co-workers get sick within 2 or 3 weeks of the flu&apos;s arrival in a school or workplace. The first symptom is a fever between 102°F (39°C) and 106°F (41°C). An adult often has a lower fever than a child. Other common symptoms include: - Body aches - Chills - Dizziness - Flushed face - Headache - Lack of energy - Nausea and vomiting The fever, aches, and pains begin to go away on days 2 through 4. But new symptoms occur, including: - Dry cough - Increased symptoms that affect breathing - Runny nose (clear and watery) - Sneezing - Sore throat Most symptoms go away in 4 to 7 days. The cough and tired feeling may last for weeks. Sometimes, the fever comes back. Some people may not feel like eating. The flu can make asthma, breathing problems, and other long-term (chronic) illnesses and conditions worse. Most people do not need to see a health care provider when they have flu symptoms. This is because most people are not at risk for a severe case of the flu. If you are very sick with the flu, you may want to see your provider. People who are at high risk for flu complications may also want to see a provider if they get the flu. When many people in an area have flu, a provider can make a diagnosis after hearing about your symptoms. No further testing is needed. There is a test to detect the flu. It is done by swabbing the nose or throat. Most of the time, test results are available very fast. The test can help your provider prescribe the best treatment. HOME CARE Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help lower fever. Providers sometimes suggest you to use both types of medicine. DO NOT use aspirin. A fever does not need to come all the way down to normal. Most people feel better when the temperature drops by 1 degree. Over-the-counter cold medicines may make some of your symptoms better. Cough drops or throat sprays will help with your sore throat. You will need a lot of rest. Drink plenty of liquids. DO NOT smoke or drink alcohol. ANTIVIRAL DRUGS Most people with milder symptoms feel better in 3 to 4 days. They do not need to see a provider or take antiviral medicines. Providers may give antiviral drugs to people who get very sick with the flu. You may need these medicines if you are more likely to have flu complications The health problems below may increase your risk of getting sicker with the flu: - Lung disease (including asthma) - Heart conditions (except high blood pressure) - Kidney, liver, nerve, and muscle conditions - Blood disorders (including sickle cell disease) - Diabetes - A weakened immune system due to diseases (such as AIDS), radiation therapy, or certain medicines, including chemotherapy and corticosteroids - Other long-term medical problem These medicines may shorten the time you have symptoms by about 1 day. They work better if you start taking them within 2 days of your first symptoms. Children at risk of a severe case of the flu may also need these medicines. Millions of people in the United States get the flu each year. Most people get better within a week or two, but thousands of people with the flu develop pneumonia or a brain infection. They need to stay in the hospital. About 36,000 people in the United States die each year of problems from the flu. Anyone at any age can have serious complications from the flu. Those at highest risk include: - People over the age of 65 - Children younger than 2 years old - Women who are more than 3 months pregnant - Anyone living in a long-term care facility - Anyone with chronic heart, lung, or kidney conditions, diabetes, or a weakened immune system Complications may include: - Pneumonia - Encephalitis (infection of the brain) - Meningitis - Seizures Call your provider if you get the flu and think you are at risk for having complications. Also, call your provider if your flu symptoms are very bad and self-treatment is not working. You can take steps to avoid catching or spreading the flu. The best step is to get a flu vaccine. If you have the flu: - Stay in your apartment, dorm room, or home for at least 24 hours after your fever has gone. - Wear a mask if you leave your room. - Avoid sharing food, utensils, cups, or bottles. - Use hand sanitizer often during the day and always after touching your face. - Cover your mouth with a tissue when coughing and throw it away after use. - Cough into your sleeve if a tissue is not available. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older should receive the influenza vaccine. For the 2016-2017 season, CDC recommends use of the flu shot (inactivated influenza vaccine or IIV) and the recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV). The nasal spray flu vaccine (live attenuated influenza vaccine or LAIV) should not be used during 2016-2017. Updated by: Linda J.

		<QuestionText>What is Seasonal Affective Disorder ?</QuestionText>

			<Answer AID="6_Answer1" SystemRank="1" ReferenceRank="3" ReferenceScore="4">
				<AnswerURL>https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20364651</AnswerURL>
				<AnswerText>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD): Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that&apos;s related to changes in seasons - SAD begins and ends at about the same times every year. If you&apos;re like most people with SAD, your symptoms start in the fall and continue into the winter months, sapping your energy and making you feel moody. Less often, SAD causes depression in the spring or early summer. Treatment for SAD may include light therapy (phototherapy), medications and psychotherapy. Don&apos;t brush off that yearly feeling as simply a case of the &quot;winter blues&quot; or a seasonal funk that you have to tough out on your own. Take steps to keep your mood and motivation steady throughout the year. In most cases, seasonal affective disorder symptoms appear during late fall or early winter and go away during the sunnier days of spring and summer. Less commonly, people with the opposite pattern have symptoms that begin in spring or summer. In either case, symptoms may start out mild and become more severe as the season progresses. Signs and symptoms of SAD may include: - Feeling depressed most of the day, nearly every day - Losing interest in activities you once enjoyed - Having low energy - Having problems with sleeping - Experiencing changes in your appetite or weight - Feeling sluggish or agitated - Having difficulty concentrating - Feeling hopeless, worthless or guilty - Having frequent thoughts of death or suicide Fall and winter SAD Symptoms specific to winter-onset SAD, sometimes called winter depression, may include: - Oversleeping - Appetite changes, especially a craving for foods high in carbohydrates - Weight gain - Tiredness or low energy Spring and summer SAD Symptoms specific to summer-onset seasonal affective disorder, sometimes called summer depression, may include: - Trouble sleeping (insomnia) - Poor appetite - Weight loss - Agitation or anxiety Seasonal changes in bipolar disorder In some people with bipolar disorder, spring and summer can bring on symptoms of mania or a less intense form of mania (hypomania), and fall and winter can be a time of depression. When to see a doctor It&apos;s normal to have some days when you feel down. But if you feel down for days at a time and you can&apos;t get motivated to do activities you normally enjoy, see your doctor. This is especially important if your sleep patterns and appetite have changed, you turn to alcohol for comfort or relaxation, or you feel hopeless or think about suicide. The specific cause of seasonal affective disorder remains unknown. Some factors that may come into play include: - Your biological clock (circadian rhythm). The reduced level of sunlight in fall and winter may cause winter-onset SAD. This decrease in sunlight may disrupt your body&apos;s internal clock and lead to feelings of depression. - Serotonin levels. A drop in serotonin, a brain chemical (neurotransmitter) that affects mood, might play a role in SAD. Reduced sunlight can cause a drop in serotonin that may trigger depression. - Melatonin levels. The change in season can disrupt the balance of the body&apos;s level of melatonin, which plays a role in sleep patterns and mood. Seasonal affective disorder is diagnosed more often in women than in men. And SAD occurs more frequently in younger adults than in older adults. Factors that may increase your risk of seasonal affective disorder include: - Family history. People with SAD may be more likely to have blood relatives with SAD or another form of depression. - Having major depression or bipolar disorder. Symptoms of depression may worsen seasonally if you have one of these conditions. - Living far from the equator. SAD appears to be more common among people who live far north or south of the equator. This may be due to decreased sunlight during the winter and longer days during the summer months. Even with a thorough evaluation, it can sometimes be difficult for your doctor or mental health professional to diagnose seasonal affective disorder because other types of depression or other mental health conditions can cause similar symptoms. To help diagnose SAD, your doctor or mental health professional may do a thorough evaluation, which generally includes: - Physical exam. Your doctor may do a physical exam and ask in-depth questions about your health. In some cases, depression may be linked to an underlying physical health problem. - Lab tests. For example, your doctor may do a blood test called a complete blood count (CBC) or test your thyroid to make sure it&apos;s functioning properly. - Psychological evaluation. To check for signs of depression, your doctor or mental health professional asks about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may fill out a questionnaire to help answer these questions. - DSM-5. Your mental health professional may use the criteria for seasonal depressive episodes listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Treatment for seasonal affective disorder may include light therapy, medications and psychotherapy. If you have bipolar disorder, tell your doctor - this is critical to know when prescribing light therapy or an antidepressant. Both treatments can potentially trigger a manic episode. Light therapy In light therapy, also called phototherapy, you sit a few feet from a special light box so that you&apos;re exposed to bright light within the first hour of waking up each day. Light therapy mimics natural outdoor light and appears to cause a change in brain chemicals linked to mood. Light therapy is one of the first line treatments for fall-onset SAD. It generally starts working in a few days to a few weeks and causes few side effects. Research on light therapy is limited, but it appears to be effective for most people in relieving SAD symptoms. Before you purchase a light box, talk with your doctor about the best one for you, and familiarize yourself with the variety of features and options so that you buy a high-quality product that&apos;s safe and effective. Also ask your doctor about how and when to use the light box. Medications Some people with SAD benefit from antidepressant treatment, especially if symptoms are severe. An extended-release version of the antidepressant bupropion (Wellbutrin XL, Aplenzin) may help prevent depressive episodes in people with a history of SAD. Other antidepressants also may commonly be used to treat SAD. Your doctor may recommend starting treatment with an antidepressant before your symptoms typically begin each year. He or she may also recommend that you continue to take the antidepressant beyond the time your symptoms normally go away. Keep in mind that it may take several weeks to notice full benefits from an antidepressant. In addition, you may have to try different medications before you find one that works well for you and has the fewest side effects. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy, also called talk therapy, is another option to treat SAD. A type of psychotherapy known as cognitive behavioral therapy can help you: - Identify and change negative thoughts and behaviors that may be making you feel worse - Learn healthy ways to cope with SAD, especially with reducing avoidance behavior and scheduling activities - Learn how to manage stress Mind-body connection Examples of mind-body techniques that some people may choose to try to help cope with SAD include: - Relaxation techniques such as yoga or tai chi - Meditation - Guided imagery - Music or art therapy In addition to your treatment plan for seasonal affective disorder: - Make your environment sunnier and brighter. Open blinds, trim tree branches that block sunlight or add skylights to your home. Sit closer to bright windows while at home or in the office. - Get outside. Take a long walk, eat lunch at a nearby park, or simply sit on a bench and soak up the sun. Even on cold or cloudy days, outdoor light can help - especially if you spend some time outside within two hours of getting up in the morning. - Exercise regularly. Exercise and other types of physical activity help relieve stress and anxiety, both of which can increase SAD symptoms. Being more fit can make you feel better about yourself, too, which can lift your mood. Certain herbal remedies, supplements or mind-body techniques are sometimes used to try to relieve depression symptoms, though it&apos;s not clear how effective these treatments are for seasonal affective disorder. Herbal remedies and dietary supplements aren&apos;t monitored by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the same way medications are, so you can&apos;t always be certain of what you&apos;re getting and whether it&apos;s safe. Also, because some herbal and dietary supplements can interfere with prescription medications or cause dangerous interactions, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking any supplements. Make sure you understand the risks as well as possible benefits if you pursue alternative or complementary therapy. When it comes to depression, alternative treatments aren&apos;t a substitute for medical care.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>IMH » Seasonal Affective Disorder: Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that comes and goes with the seasons, typically starting in the late fall and early winter and going away during the spring and summer. Depressive episodes linked to the summer can occur, but are much less common than winter episodes of SAD. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is not considered as a separate disorder. It is a type of depression displaying a recurring seasonal pattern. To be diagnosed with SAD, people must meet full criteria for major depression coinciding with specific seasons (appearing in the winter or summer months) for at least 2 years. Seasonal depressions must be much more frequent than any non-seasonal depressions. Symptoms of Major Depression - Feeling depressed most of the day, nearly every day - Feeling hopeless or worthless - Having low energy - Losing interest in activities you once enjoyed - Having problems with sleep - Experiencing changes in your appetite or weight - Feeling sluggish or agitated - Having difficulty concentrating - Having frequent thoughts of death or suicide. Symptoms of the Winter Pattern of SAD include: - Having low energy - Hypersomnia - Overeating - Weight gain - Craving for carbohydrates - Social withdrawal (feel like “hibernating”) Symptoms of the less frequently occurring summer seasonal affective disorder include: - Poor appetite with associated weight loss - Insomnia - Agitation - Restlessness - Anxiety - Episodes of violent behavior Attributes that may increase your risk of SAD include: - Being female. SAD is diagnosed four times  more often in women than men. - Living far from the equator. SAD is more frequent in people who live far north or south of the equator. For example, 1 percent of those who live in Florida and 9 percent of those who live in New England or Alaska suffer from SAD.  - Family history. People with a family history of other types of depression are more likely to develop SAD than people who do not have a family history of depression. - Having depression or bipolar disorder. The symptoms of depression may worsen with the seasons if you have one of these conditions (but SAD is diagnosed only if seasonal depressions are the most common). - Younger Age. Younger adults have a higher risk of SAD than older adults. SAD has been reported even in children and teens. The causes of SAD are unknown, but research has found some biological clues:  - People with SAD may have trouble regulating one of the key neurotransmitters involved in mood, serotonin. One study found that people with SAD have 5 percent more serotonin transporter protein in winter months than summer months. Higher serotonin transporter protein leaves less serotonin available at the synapse because the function of the transporter is to recycle neurotransmitter back into the pre-synaptic neuron. - People with SAD may overproduce the hormone melatonin. Darkness increases production of melatonin, which regulates sleep. As winter days become shorter, melatonin production increases, leaving people with SAD to feel sleepier and more lethargic, often with delayed circadian rhythms. - People with SAD also may produce less Vitamin D. Vitamin D is believed to play a role in serotonin activity. Vitamin D insufficiency may be associated with clinically significant depression symptoms. There are four major types of treatment for SAD: - Medication - Light therapy - Psychotherapy - Vitamin D  These may be used alone or in combination. Medication Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are used to treat SAD. The FDA has also approved the use of bupropion , another type of antidepressant, for treating SAD. As with other medications, there are side effects to SSRIs. Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this medication for your condition. You may need to try several different antidepressant medications before finding the one that improves your symptoms without causing problematic side effects. For basic information about SSRIs and other mental health medications, visit NIMH’s Medications webpage. Check the FDA’s website  for the latest information on warnings, patient medication guides, or newly approved medications. Light Therapy Light therapy has been a mainstay of treatment for SAD since the 1980s. The idea behind light therapy is to replace the diminished sunshine of the fall and winter months using daily exposure to bright, artificial light. Symptoms of SAD may be relieved by sitting in front of a light box first thing in the morning, on a daily basis from the early fall until spring. Most typically, light boxes filter out the ultraviolet rays and require 20-60 minutes of exposure to 10,000 lux of cool-white fluorescent light, an amount that is about 20 times greater than ordinary indoor lighting. Psychotherapy Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is type of psychotherapy that is effective for SAD. Traditional cognitive behavioral therapy has been adapted for use with SAD (CBT-SAD). CBT-SAD relies on basic techniques of CBT such as identifying negative thoughts and replacing them with more positive thoughts along with a technique called behavioral activation. Behavioral activation seeks to help the person identify activities that are engaging and pleasurable, whether indoors or outdoors, to improve coping with winter. Vitamin D At present, vitamin D supplementation by itself is not regarded as an effective SAD treatment. The reason behind its use is that low blood levels of vitamin D were found in people with SAD. The low levels are usually due to insufficient dietary intake or insufficient exposure to sunshine. However, the evidence for its use has been mixed. While some studies suggest vitamin D supplementation may be as effective as light therapy, others found vitamin D had no effect .</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) (Risk factors): Seasonal affective disorder is diagnosed more often in women than in men. And SAD occurs more frequently in younger adults than in older adults. Factors that may increase your risk of seasonal affective disorder include: - Family history. People with SAD may be more likely to have blood relatives with SAD or another form of depression. - Having major depression or bipolar disorder. Symptoms of depression may worsen seasonally if you have one of these conditions. - Living far from the equator. SAD appears to be more common among people who live far north or south of the equator. This may be due to decreased sunlight during the winter and longer days during the summer months.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Seasonal affective disorder: Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that occurs at a certain time of the year, usually in winter. SAD may begin during the teen years or in adulthood. Like other forms of depression, it occurs more often in women than in men. People who live in places with long winter nights are at high risk of developing SAD. A less common form of the disorder involves depression during the summer months. Symptoms usually build up slowly in the late autumn and winter months. Symptoms are often the same as with other forms of depression: - Hopelessness - Increased appetite with weight gain (weight loss is more common with other forms of depression) - Increased sleep (too little sleep is more common with other forms of depression) - Less energy and ability to concentrate - Loss of interest in work or other activities - Sluggish movements - Social withdrawal - Unhappiness and irritability SAD can sometimes become long-term depression. Bipolar disorder or thoughts of suicide are also possible. There is no test for SAD. Your health care provider can make a diagnosis by asking about your history of symptoms. Your provider may also perform a physical exam and blood tests to rule out other disorders that are similar to SAD. As with other types of depression, antidepressant medicines and talk therapy can be effective. MANAGING YOUR DEPRESSION AT HOME To manage your symptoms at home: - Get enough sleep. - Eat healthy foods. - Take medicines the right way. Ask your provider how to manage side effects. - Learn to watch for early signs that your depression is getting worse. Have a plan if it does get worse. - Try to exercise more often. Do activities that make you happy. DO NOT use alcohol or illegal drugs. These can make depression worse. They can also cause you to think about suicide. When you are struggling with depression, talk about how you are feeling with someone you trust. Try to be around people who are caring and positive. Volunteer or get involved in group activities. LIGHT THERAPY Your provider may prescribe light therapy. Light therapy uses a special lamp with a very bright light that mimics light from the sun: - Treatment is started in the fall or early winter, before the symptoms of SAD begin. - Follow your provider&apos;s instructions about how to use light therapy. One way that may be recommended is to sit a couple of feet (60 centimeters) away from the light box for about 30 minutes each day. This is often done in the early morning, to mimic sunrise. - Keep your eyes open, but do not look straight into the light source. If light therapy is going to help, symptoms of depression should improve within 3 to 4 weeks. Side effects of light therapy include: - Eye strain or headache - Mania (rarely) People who take medicines that make them more sensitive to light, such as certain psoriasis drugs, antibiotics, or antipsychotics, should not use light therapy. A checkup with your eye doctor is recommended before starting treatment. With no treatment, symptoms usually get better on their own with the change of seasons. Symptoms can improve more quickly with treatment. The outcome is usually good with treatment. But some people have SAD throughout their lives. Get medical help right away if you have thoughts of hurting yourself or anyone else. Updated by: Timothy Rogge, MD, Medical Director, Family Medical Psychiatry Center, Kirkland, WA.

				<AnswerText>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD): Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that&apos;s related to changes in seasons - SAD begins and ends at about the same times every year. If you&apos;re like most people with SAD, your symptoms start in the fall and continue into the winter months, sapping your energy and making you feel moody. Less often, SAD causes depression in the spring or early summer. Treatment for SAD may include light therapy (phototherapy), medications and psychotherapy. Don&apos;t brush off that yearly feeling as simply a case of the &quot;winter blues&quot; or a seasonal funk that you have to tough out on your own. Take steps to keep your mood and motivation steady throughout the year. In most cases, seasonal affective disorder symptoms appear during late fall or early winter and go away during the sunnier days of spring and summer. Less commonly, people with the opposite pattern have symptoms that begin in spring or summer. In either case, symptoms may start out mild and become more severe as the season progresses. Signs and symptoms of SAD may include: - Feeling depressed most of the day, nearly every day - Losing interest in activities you once enjoyed - Having low energy - Having problems with sleeping - Experiencing changes in your appetite or weight - Feeling sluggish or agitated - Having difficulty concentrating - Feeling hopeless, worthless or guilty - Having frequent thoughts of death or suicide Fall and winter SAD Symptoms specific to winter-onset SAD, sometimes called winter depression, may include: - Oversleeping - Appetite changes, especially a craving for foods high in carbohydrates - Weight gain - Tiredness or low energy Spring and summer SAD Symptoms specific to summer-onset seasonal affective disorder, sometimes called summer depression, may include: - Trouble sleeping (insomnia) - Poor appetite - Weight loss - Agitation or anxiety Seasonal changes in bipolar disorder In some people with bipolar disorder, spring and summer can bring on symptoms of mania or a less intense form of mania (hypomania), and fall and winter can be a time of depression. When to see a doctor It&apos;s normal to have some days when you feel down. But if you feel down for days at a time and you can&apos;t get motivated to do activities you normally enjoy, see your doctor. This is especially important if your sleep patterns and appetite have changed, you turn to alcohol for comfort or relaxation, or you feel hopeless or think about suicide. The specific cause of seasonal affective disorder remains unknown. Some factors that may come into play include: - Your biological clock (circadian rhythm). The reduced level of sunlight in fall and winter may cause winter-onset SAD. This decrease in sunlight may disrupt your body&apos;s internal clock and lead to feelings of depression. - Serotonin levels. A drop in serotonin, a brain chemical (neurotransmitter) that affects mood, might play a role in SAD. Reduced sunlight can cause a drop in serotonin that may trigger depression. - Melatonin levels. The change in season can disrupt the balance of the body&apos;s level of melatonin, which plays a role in sleep patterns and mood. Seasonal affective disorder is diagnosed more often in women than in men. And SAD occurs more frequently in younger adults than in older adults. Factors that may increase your risk of seasonal affective disorder include: - Family history. People with SAD may be more likely to have blood relatives with SAD or another form of depression. - Having major depression or bipolar disorder. Symptoms of depression may worsen seasonally if you have one of these conditions. - Living far from the equator. SAD appears to be more common among people who live far north or south of the equator. This may be due to decreased sunlight during the winter and longer days during the summer months. Even with a thorough evaluation, it can sometimes be difficult for your doctor or mental health professional to diagnose seasonal affective disorder because other types of depression or other mental health conditions can cause similar symptoms. To help diagnose SAD, your doctor or mental health professional may do a thorough evaluation, which generally includes: - Physical exam. Your doctor may do a physical exam and ask in-depth questions about your health. In some cases, depression may be linked to an underlying physical health problem. - Lab tests. For example, your doctor may do a blood test called a complete blood count (CBC) or test your thyroid to make sure it&apos;s functioning properly. - Psychological evaluation. To check for signs of depression, your doctor or mental health professional asks about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may fill out a questionnaire to help answer these questions. - DSM-5. Your mental health professional may use the criteria for seasonal depressive episodes listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Treatment for seasonal affective disorder may include light therapy, medications and psychotherapy. If you have bipolar disorder, tell your doctor - this is critical to know when prescribing light therapy or an antidepressant. Both treatments can potentially trigger a manic episode. Light therapy In light therapy, also called phototherapy, you sit a few feet from a special light box so that you&apos;re exposed to bright light within the first hour of waking up each day. Light therapy mimics natural outdoor light and appears to cause a change in brain chemicals linked to mood. Light therapy is one of the first line treatments for fall-onset SAD. It generally starts working in a few days to a few weeks and causes few side effects. Research on light therapy is limited, but it appears to be effective for most people in relieving SAD symptoms. Before you purchase a light box, talk with your doctor about the best one for you, and familiarize yourself with the variety of features and options so that you buy a high-quality product that&apos;s safe and effective. Also ask your doctor about how and when to use the light box. Medications Some people with SAD benefit from antidepressant treatment, especially if symptoms are severe. An extended-release version of the antidepressant bupropion (Wellbutrin XL, Aplenzin) may help prevent depressive episodes in people with a history of SAD. Other antidepressants also may commonly be used to treat SAD. Your doctor may recommend starting treatment with an antidepressant before your symptoms typically begin each year. He or she may also recommend that you continue to take the antidepressant beyond the time your symptoms normally go away. Keep in mind that it may take several weeks to notice full benefits from an antidepressant. In addition, you may have to try different medications before you find one that works well for you and has the fewest side effects. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy, also called talk therapy, is another option to treat SAD. A type of psychotherapy known as cognitive behavioral therapy can help you: - Identify and change negative thoughts and behaviors that may be making you feel worse - Learn healthy ways to cope with SAD, especially with reducing avoidance behavior and scheduling activities - Learn how to manage stress Mind-body connection Examples of mind-body techniques that some people may choose to try to help cope with SAD include: - Relaxation techniques such as yoga or tai chi - Meditation - Guided imagery - Music or art therapy In addition to your treatment plan for seasonal affective disorder: - Make your environment sunnier and brighter. Open blinds, trim tree branches that block sunlight or add skylights to your home. Sit closer to bright windows while at home or in the office. - Get outside. Take a long walk, eat lunch at a nearby park, or simply sit on a bench and soak up the sun. Even on cold or cloudy days, outdoor light can help - especially if you spend some time outside within two hours of getting up in the morning. - Exercise regularly. Exercise and other types of physical activity help relieve stress and anxiety, both of which can increase SAD symptoms. Being more fit can make you feel better about yourself, too, which can lift your mood. Certain herbal remedies, supplements or mind-body techniques are sometimes used to try to relieve depression symptoms, though it&apos;s not clear how effective these treatments are for seasonal affective disorder.

It generally starts working in a few days to a few weeks and causes few side effects. Research on light therapy is limited, but it appears to be effective for most people in relieving SAD symptoms. Before you purchase a light box, talk with your doctor about the best one for you, and familiarize yourself with the variety of features and options so that you buy a high-quality product that&apos;s safe and effective. Also ask your doctor about how and when to use the light box. Medications Some people with SAD benefit from antidepressant treatment, especially if symptoms are severe. An extended-release version of the antidepressant bupropion (Wellbutrin XL, Aplenzin) may help prevent depressive episodes in people with a history of SAD. Other antidepressants also may commonly be used to treat SAD. Your doctor may recommend starting treatment with an antidepressant before your symptoms typically begin each year. He or she may also recommend that you continue to take the antidepressant beyond the time your symptoms normally go away. Keep in mind that it may take several weeks to notice full benefits from an antidepressant. In addition, you may have to try different medications before you find one that works well for you and has the fewest side effects. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy, also called talk therapy, is another option to treat SAD. A type of psychotherapy known as cognitive behavioral therapy can help you: - Identify and change negative thoughts and behaviors that may be making you feel worse - Learn healthy ways to cope with SAD, especially with reducing avoidance behavior and scheduling activities - Learn how to manage stress Mind-body connection Examples of mind-body techniques that some people may choose to try to help cope with SAD include: - Relaxation techniques such as yoga or tai chi - Meditation - Guided imagery - Music or art therapy In addition to your treatment plan for seasonal affective disorder: - Make your environment sunnier and brighter. Open blinds, trim tree branches that block sunlight or add skylights to your home. Sit closer to bright windows while at home or in the office. - Get outside. Take a long walk, eat lunch at a nearby park, or simply sit on a bench and soak up the sun. Even on cold or cloudy days, outdoor light can help - especially if you spend some time outside within two hours of getting up in the morning. - Exercise regularly. Exercise and other types of physical activity help relieve stress and anxiety, both of which can increase SAD symptoms. Being more fit can make you feel better about yourself, too, which can lift your mood. Certain herbal remedies, supplements or mind-body techniques are sometimes used to try to relieve depression symptoms, though it&apos;s not clear how effective these treatments are for seasonal affective disorder. Herbal remedies and dietary supplements aren&apos;t monitored by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the same way medications are, so you can&apos;t always be certain of what you&apos;re getting and whether it&apos;s safe. Also, because some herbal and dietary supplements can interfere with prescription medications or cause dangerous interactions, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking any supplements. Make sure you understand the risks as well as possible benefits if you pursue alternative or complementary therapy. When it comes to depression, alternative treatments aren&apos;t a substitute for medical care.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) (Treatment): Treatment for seasonal affective disorder may include light therapy, medications and psychotherapy. If you have bipolar disorder, tell your doctor - this is critical to know when prescribing light therapy or an antidepressant. Both treatments can potentially trigger a manic episode. Light therapy In light therapy, also called phototherapy, you sit a few feet from a special light box so that you&apos;re exposed to bright light within the first hour of waking up each day.

				<AnswerText>What are the treatments for Seasonal affective disorder?: As with other types of depression, antidepressant medicines and talk therapy can be effective. MANAGING YOUR DEPRESSION AT HOME To manage your symptoms at home: - Get enough sleep. - Eat healthy foods. - Take medicines the right way. Ask your provider how to manage side effects. - Learn to watch for early signs that your depression is getting worse. Have a plan if it does get worse. - Try to exercise more often. Do activities that make you happy. DO NOT use alcohol or illegal drugs. These can make depression worse. They can also cause you to think about suicide. When you are struggling with depression, talk about how you are feeling with someone you trust. Try to be around people who are caring and positive. Volunteer or get involved in group activities. LIGHT THERAPY Your provider may prescribe light therapy. Light therapy uses a special lamp with a very bright light that mimics light from the sun: - Treatment is started in the fall or early winter, before the symptoms of SAD begin. - Follow your provider&apos;s instructions about how to use light therapy. One way that may be recommended is to sit a couple of feet away from the light box for about 30 minutes each day. This is usually done in the early morning, to mimic sunrise. - Keep your eyes open, but do not look straight into the light source. If light therapy is going to help, symptoms of depression should improve within 3 to 4 weeks. Side effects of light therapy include: - Eye strain or headache - Mania (rarely) People who take medicines that make them more sensitive to light, such as certain psoriasis drugs, antibiotics, or antipsychotics, should not use light therapy. A checkup with your eye doctor is recommended before starting treatment. With no treatment, symptoms usually get better on their own with the change of seasons. Symptoms can improve more quickly with treatment.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD): Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that&apos;s related to changes in seasons - SAD begins and ends at about the same times every year. If you&apos;re like most people with SAD, your symptoms start in the fall and continue into the winter months, sapping your energy and making you feel moody. Less often, SAD causes depression in the spring or early summer. Treatment for SAD may include light therapy (phototherapy), medications and psychotherapy. Don&apos;t brush off that yearly feeling as simply a case of the &quot;winter blues&quot; or a seasonal funk that you have to tough out on your own. Take steps to keep your mood and motivation steady throughout the year. In most cases, seasonal affective disorder symptoms appear during late fall or early winter and go away during the sunnier days of spring and summer. Less commonly, people with the opposite pattern have symptoms that begin in spring or summer. In either case, symptoms may start out mild and become more severe as the season progresses. Signs and symptoms of SAD may include: - Feeling depressed most of the day, nearly every day - Losing interest in activities you once enjoyed - Having low energy - Having problems with sleeping - Experiencing changes in your appetite or weight - Feeling sluggish or agitated - Having difficulty concentrating - Feeling hopeless, worthless or guilty - Having frequent thoughts of death or suicide Fall and winter SAD Symptoms specific to winter-onset SAD, sometimes called winter depression, may include: - Oversleeping - Appetite changes, especially a craving for foods high in carbohydrates - Weight gain - Tiredness or low energy Spring and summer SAD Symptoms specific to summer-onset seasonal affective disorder, sometimes called summer depression, may include: - Trouble sleeping (insomnia) - Poor appetite - Weight loss - Agitation or anxiety Seasonal changes in bipolar disorder In some people with bipolar disorder, spring and summer can bring on symptoms of mania or a less intense form of mania (hypomania), and fall and winter can be a time of depression. When to see a doctor It&apos;s normal to have some days when you feel down. But if you feel down for days at a time and you can&apos;t get motivated to do activities you normally enjoy, see your doctor. This is especially important if your sleep patterns and appetite have changed, you turn to alcohol for comfort or relaxation, or you feel hopeless or think about suicide.

You may fill out a questionnaire to help answer these questions. - DSM-5. Your mental health professional may use the criteria for seasonal depressive episodes listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Treatment for seasonal affective disorder may include light therapy, medications and psychotherapy. If you have bipolar disorder, tell your doctor - this is critical to know when prescribing light therapy or an antidepressant. Both treatments can potentially trigger a manic episode. Light therapy In light therapy, also called phototherapy, you sit a few feet from a special light box so that you&apos;re exposed to bright light within the first hour of waking up each day. Light therapy mimics natural outdoor light and appears to cause a change in brain chemicals linked to mood. Light therapy is one of the first line treatments for fall-onset SAD. It generally starts working in a few days to a few weeks and causes few side effects. Research on light therapy is limited, but it appears to be effective for most people in relieving SAD symptoms. Before you purchase a light box, talk with your doctor about the best one for you, and familiarize yourself with the variety of features and options so that you buy a high-quality product that&apos;s safe and effective. Also ask your doctor about how and when to use the light box. Medications Some people with SAD benefit from antidepressant treatment, especially if symptoms are severe. An extended-release version of the antidepressant bupropion (Wellbutrin XL, Aplenzin) may help prevent depressive episodes in people with a history of SAD. Other antidepressants also may commonly be used to treat SAD. Your doctor may recommend starting treatment with an antidepressant before your symptoms typically begin each year. He or she may also recommend that you continue to take the antidepressant beyond the time your symptoms normally go away. Keep in mind that it may take several weeks to notice full benefits from an antidepressant. In addition, you may have to try different medications before you find one that works well for you and has the fewest side effects. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy, also called talk therapy, is another option to treat SAD. A type of psychotherapy known as cognitive behavioral therapy can help you: - Identify and change negative thoughts and behaviors that may be making you feel worse - Learn healthy ways to cope with SAD, especially with reducing avoidance behavior and scheduling activities - Learn how to manage stress Mind-body connection Examples of mind-body techniques that some people may choose to try to help cope with SAD include: - Relaxation techniques such as yoga or tai chi - Meditation - Guided imagery - Music or art therapy In addition to your treatment plan for seasonal affective disorder: - Make your environment sunnier and brighter. Open blinds, trim tree branches that block sunlight or add skylights to your home. Sit closer to bright windows while at home or in the office. - Get outside. Take a long walk, eat lunch at a nearby park, or simply sit on a bench and soak up the sun. Even on cold or cloudy days, outdoor light can help - especially if you spend some time outside within two hours of getting up in the morning. - Exercise regularly. Exercise and other types of physical activity help relieve stress and anxiety, both of which can increase SAD symptoms. Being more fit can make you feel better about yourself, too, which can lift your mood. Certain herbal remedies, supplements or mind-body techniques are sometimes used to try to relieve depression symptoms, though it&apos;s not clear how effective these treatments are for seasonal affective disorder. Herbal remedies and dietary supplements aren&apos;t monitored by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the same way medications are, so you can&apos;t always be certain of what you&apos;re getting and whether it&apos;s safe. Also, because some herbal and dietary supplements can interfere with prescription medications or cause dangerous interactions, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking any supplements. Make sure you understand the risks as well as possible benefits if you pursue alternative or complementary therapy. When it comes to depression, alternative treatments aren&apos;t a substitute for medical care.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) (Risk factors): Seasonal affective disorder is diagnosed more often in women than in men. And SAD occurs more frequently in younger adults than in older adults. Factors that may increase your risk of seasonal affective disorder include: - Family history. People with SAD may be more likely to have blood relatives with SAD or another form of depression. - Having major depression or bipolar disorder. Symptoms of depression may worsen seasonally if you have one of these conditions. - Living far from the equator. SAD appears to be more common among people who live far north or south of the equator. This may be due to decreased sunlight during the winter and longer days during the summer months.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Stroke: A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly interrupted or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, spilling blood into the spaces surrounding brain cells. Brain cells die when they no longer receive oxygen and nutrients from the blood or there is sudden bleeding into or around the brain. The symptoms of a stroke include sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body; sudden confusion or trouble speaking or understanding speech; sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes; sudden trouble with walking, dizziness, or loss of balance or coordination; or sudden severe headache with no known cause. There are two forms of stroke: ischemic - blockage of a blood vessel supplying the brain, and hemorrhagic - bleeding into or around the brain. Generally there are three treatment stages for stroke: prevention, therapy immediately after the stroke, and post-stroke rehabilitation. Therapies to prevent a first or recurrent stroke are based on treating an individual&apos;s underlying risk factors for stroke, such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes. Acute stroke therapies try to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot causing an ischemic stroke or by stopping the bleeding of a hemorrhagic stroke. Post-stroke rehabilitation helps individuals overcome disabilities that result from stroke damage. Medication or drug therapy is the most common treatment for stroke. The most popular classes of drugs used to prevent or treat stroke are antithrombotics (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) and thrombolytics. Although stroke is a disease of the brain, it can affect the entire body. A common disability that results from stroke is complete paralysis on one side of the body, called hemiplegia. A related disability that is not as debilitating as paralysis is one-sided weakness or hemiparesis. Stroke may cause problems with thinking, awareness, attention, learning, judgment, and memory. Stroke survivors often have problems understanding or forming speech. A stroke can lead to emotional problems. Stroke patients may have difficulty controlling their emotions or may express inappropriate emotions. Many stroke patients experience depression. Stroke survivors may also have numbness or strange sensations. The pain is often worse in the hands and feet and is made worse by movement and temperature changes, especially cold temperatures. Recurrent stroke is frequent; about 25 percent of people who recover from their first stroke will have another stroke within 5 years.</AnswerText>

Stroke strikes fast. You should too. Call 911. Never ignore the symptoms of stroke. Call 911 if you have any stroke symptoms, even if they don&apos;t last long. DON&apos;T IGNORE THE SIGNS OF STROKE! A stroke happens when something changes how blood flows through the brain. Blood brings oxygen and nutrients to brain cells. If blood can&apos;t flow to a part of the brain, cells that do not receive enough oxygen suffer and eventually die. If brain cells are without oxygen for only a short time, they can sometimes get better. But brain cells that have died can&apos;t be brought back to life. So, someone who has had a stroke may have trouble speaking, thinking, or walking.There are two major types of stroke. The most common kind, ischemic, is caused by a blood clot or the narrowing of a blood vessel (an artery) leading to the brain. This keeps blood from flowing into other parts of the brain and keeps needed oxygen and nutrients from reaching brain cells. Blockages that cause ischemic strokes stem from three conditions:- Formation of a clot within a blood vessel of the brain or neck, called thrombosis - Movement of a clot from another part of the body, such as from the heart to the neck or brain, called an embolism - Severe narrowing of an artery (stenosis) in or leading to the brain, due to fatty deposits lining the blood vessel wallsIn the second major kind of stroke, hemorrhagic, a broken blood vessel causes bleeding in the brain. This break in the vessel also stops oxygen and nutrients from reaching brain cells.Sometimes the symptoms of a stroke last only a few minutes and then go away. That could be a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a mini-stroke. A TIA is a medical emergency. You should get medical help right away. If a TIA is not treated quickly, it could be followed within hours or days by a major disabling stroke. Some risk factors for stroke, like age, race, and family history, can&apos;t be controlled. But you can make changes to lower your risk of stroke. Talk to your doctor about what you can do. Even if you&apos;re in perfect health, follow these suggestions:- Control your blood pressure. Have your blood pressure checked often. If it is high, follow your doctor&apos;s advice to lower it. Treating high blood pressure lowers the risk of both stroke and heart disease. - Stop smoking. Smoking increases your risk for stroke. It&apos;s never too late to quit. - Control your cholesterol. If you have high cholesterol, work with your doctor to lower it. Cholesterol, a type of fat in the blood, can build up on the walls of your arteries. In time, this can block blood flow and lead to a stroke. - Control your diabetes. Untreated diabetes can damage blood vessels and also leads to narrowed arteries and stroke. Follow your doctor&apos;s suggestions for keeping diabetes under control. - Eat healthy foods. Eat foods that are low in cholesterol and saturated fats. Include a variety of fruits and vegetables every day. - Exercise regularly. Try to make physical activity a part of your everyday life. Do things you like; for example, take a brisk walk, ride a bicycle, or go swimming. Talk with your healthcare provider if you haven&apos;t been exercising and you want to start a vigorous program or increase your physical activity. For more information on exercise and physical activity from the National Institute on Aging at NIH, visit www.nia.nih.gov/Go4Life.If you have had a stroke in the past, it&apos;s important to reduce your risk of a second stroke. Your brain helps you recover from a stroke by drawing on body systems that now do double duty. That means a second stroke can be twice as bad. A doctor will diagnose a stroke based on symptoms, medical history, and medical tests such as a CT scan. A CT scan is a test that lets doctors look closely at pictures of the brain.All strokes benefit from immediate medical treatment! But only people with ischemic stroke, the kind caused by a blood clot, can be helped by a drug called t-PA (tissue-plasminogen activator). This drug breaks up blood clots and can greatly lessen the damage caused by an ischemic stroke. Starting treatment with t-PA within 3 hours after an ischemic stroke is important to recovery. To be evaluated and receive treatment, patients need to get to the hospital within 60 minutes. Getting to a hospital right away allows time for a CT scan of the brain. This scan will show whether the clot-busting medicine is the right treatment choice.With stroke, treatment depends on the stage of the disease. There are three treatment stages for stroke: prevention, therapy immediately after stroke, and rehabilitation after stroke. Stroke therapies include medications, surgery, and rehabilitation.Medication or drug therapy is the most common treatment for stroke. The most popular kinds of drugs to prevent or treat stroke are antithrombotics--which include antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants--and thrombolytics. Thrombolytic drugs, like t-PA, halt the stroke by dissolving the blood clot that is blocking blood flow to the brain. Antithrombotics prevent the formation of blood clots that can become stuck in an artery of the brain and cause strokes.Surgery and vascular procedures can be used to prevent stroke, treat stroke, or repair damage to the blood vessels or malformations in and around the brain. These include angioplasty, stenting, and carotid endarterectomy. A stroke can cause a variety of health problems. How a stroke affects a person depends on which part of the brain is damaged.Someone who has had a stroke might be paralyzed or have weakness, usually on one side of the body. He or she might have trouble speaking or using words. There could be swallowing problems. There might be pain or numbness.Stroke may cause problems with thinking, awareness, attention, learning, judgment, and memory. Someone who has had a stroke might feel depressed or find it hard to control emotions. Post-stroke depression may be more than general sadness resulting from the stroke incident. It is a serious behavioral problem that can hamper recovery and rehabilitation and may even lead to suicide.There are many different ways to help people get better after a stroke. Many treatments start in the hospital and continue at home. Drugs and physical therapy can help improve balance, coordination, and problems such as trouble speaking and using words. Occupational therapy can make it easier to do things like taking a bath or cooking.Some people make a full recovery soon after a stroke. Others take months or even years. But, sometimes the damage is so serious that therapy cannot really help.Learn about rehabilitation after stroke. Stroke is the number one cause of serious adult disability in the United States. Stroke disability is devastating to the stroke patient and family, but therapies are available to help rehabilitate patients after stroke.For most stroke patients, rehabilitation mainly involves physical therapy. The aim of physical therapy is to have the stroke patient relearn simple motor activities such as walking, sitting, standing, lying down, and the process of switching from one type of movement to another.Another type of therapy to help patients relearn daily activities is occupational therapy. This type of therapy also involves exercise and training. Its goal is to help the stroke patient relearn everyday activities such as eating, drinking and swallowing, dressing, bathing, cooking, reading and writing, and using the toilet. Occupational therapists seek to help the patient become independent or semi-independent.Speech therapy helps stroke patients relearn language and speaking skills, or learn other forms of communication. Speech therapy is appropriate for patients who have no problems with cognition or thinking, but have problems understanding speech or written words, or problems forming speech. With time and patience, a stroke survivor should be able to regain some, and sometimes all, language and speaking abilities.Learn more about stroke signs, treatment, and prevention from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

				<AnswerText>What is Stroke?: Stroke -- A Serious Event A stroke is serious, just like a heart attack. Each year in the United States, approximately 795,000 people have a stroke. About 610,000 of these are first or new strokes. On average, one American dies from stroke every four minutes. Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, and causes more serious long-term disabilities than any other disease. Nearly three-quarters of all strokes occur in people over the age of 65. And the risk of having a stroke more than doubles each decade between the ages of 55 and 85. Stroke occurs in all age groups, in both sexes, and in all races in every country. It can even occur before birth, when the fetus is still in the womb. Learning about stroke can help you act in time to save a relative, neighbor, or friend. And making changes in your lifestyle can help you prevent stroke. What Is Stroke? A stroke is sometimes called a &quot;brain attack.&quot; Most often, stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain stops because it is blocked by a clot. When this happens, the brain cells in the immediate area begin to die. Some brain cells die because they stop getting the oxygen and nutrients they need to function. Other brain cells die because they are damaged by sudden bleeding into or around the brain. The brain cells that don&apos;t die immediately remain at risk for death. These cells can linger in a compromised or weakened state for several hours. With timely treatment, these cells can be saved. New treatments are available that greatly reduce the damage caused by a stroke. But you need to arrive at the hospital as soon as possible after symptoms start to prevent disability and to greatly improve your chances for recovery. Knowing stroke symptoms, calling 911 immediately, and getting to a hospital as quickly as possible are critical. Ischemic Stroke There are two kinds of stroke. The most common kind of stroke is called ischemic stroke. It accounts for approximately 80 percent of all strokes. An ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain. Blockages that cause ischemic strokes stem from three conditions: - the formation of a clot within a blood vessel of the brain or neck, called thrombosis - the movement of a clot from another part of the body, such as from the heart to the neck or brain, called an embolism - a severe narrowing of an artery (stenosis) in or leading to the brain, due to fatty deposits lining the blood vessel walls. the formation of a clot within a blood vessel of the brain or neck, called thrombosis the movement of a clot from another part of the body, such as from the heart to the neck or brain, called an embolism a severe narrowing of an artery (stenosis) in or leading to the brain, due to fatty deposits lining the blood vessel walls. Hemorrhagic Stroke The other kind of stroke is called hemorrhagic stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain. One common cause of a hemorrhagic stroke is a bleeding aneurysm. An aneurysm is a weak or thin spot on an artery wall. Over time, these weak spots stretch or balloon out due to high blood pressure. The thin walls of these ballooning aneurysms can rupture and spill blood into the space surrounding brain cells. Artery walls can also break open because they become encrusted, or covered with fatty deposits called plaque, eventually lose their elasticity and become brittle, thin, and prone to cracking. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, increases the risk that a brittle artery wall will give way and release blood into the surrounding brain tissue.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Stroke: A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of your brain is interrupted or reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. A stroke is a medical emergency. Prompt treatment is crucial. Early action can minimize brain damage and potential complications. The good news is that strokes can be treated and prevented, and many fewer Americans die of stroke now than in the past. Watch for these signs and symptoms if you think you or someone else may be having a stroke. Pay attention to when the signs and symptoms begin. The length of time they have been present can affect your treatment options: - Trouble with speaking and understanding. You may experience confusion. You may slur your words or have difficulty understanding speech. - Paralysis or numbness of the face, arm or leg. You may develop sudden numbness, weakness or paralysis in your face, arm or leg. This often happens just on one side of your body. Try to raise both your arms over your head at the same time. If one arm begins to fall, you may be having a stroke. Also, one side of your mouth may droop when you try to smile. - Trouble with seeing in one or both eyes. You may suddenly have blurred or blackened vision in one or both eyes, or you may see double. - Headache. A sudden, severe headache, which may be accompanied by vomiting, dizziness or altered consciousness, may indicate you&apos;re having a stroke. - Trouble with walking. You may stumble or experience sudden dizziness, loss of balance or loss of coordination. When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical attention if you notice any signs or symptoms of a stroke, even if they seem to fluctuate or disappear. Think &quot;FAST&quot; and do the following: - Face. Ask the person to smile. Does one side of the face droop? - Arms. Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward? Or is one arm unable to rise up? - Speech. Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase. Is his or her speech slurred or strange? - Time. If you observe any of these signs, call 911 immediately. Call 911 or your local emergency number right away. Don&apos;t wait to see if symptoms stop. Every minute counts. The longer a stroke goes untreated, the greater the potential for brain damage and disability. If you&apos;re with someone you suspect is having a stroke, watch the person carefully while waiting for emergency assistance. A stroke may be caused by a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or the leaking or bursting of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke). Some people may experience only a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain (transient ischemic attack, or TIA) that doesn&apos;t cause permanent damage. Ischemic stroke About 80 percent of strokes are ischemic strokes. Ischemic strokes occur when the arteries to your brain become narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow (ischemia). The most common ischemic strokes include: - Thrombotic stroke. A thrombotic stroke occurs when a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one of the arteries that supply blood to your brain. A clot may be caused by fatty deposits (plaque) that build up in arteries and cause reduced blood flow (atherosclerosis) or other artery conditions. - Embolic stroke. An embolic stroke occurs when a blood clot or other debris forms away from your brain - commonly in your heart - and is swept through your bloodstream to lodge in narrower brain arteries. This type of blood clot is called an embolus. Hemorrhagic stroke Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in your brain leaks or ruptures. Brain hemorrhages can result from many conditions that affect your blood vessels. These include: - Uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension) - Overtreatment with anticoagulants (blood thinners) - Weak spots in your blood vessel walls (aneurysms) A less common cause of hemorrhage is the rupture of an abnormal tangle of thin-walled blood vessels (arteriovenous malformation). Types of hemorrhagic stroke include: - Intracerebral hemorrhage. In an intracerebral hemorrhage, a blood vessel in the brain bursts and spills into the surrounding brain tissue, damaging brain cells. Brain cells beyond the leak are deprived of blood and are also damaged. High blood pressure, trauma, vascular malformations, use of blood-thinning medications and other conditions may cause an intracerebral hemorrhage. - Subarachnoid hemorrhage. In a subarachnoid hemorrhage, an artery on or near the surface of your brain bursts and spills into the space between the surface of your brain and your skull. This bleeding is often signaled by a sudden, severe headache. A subarachnoid hemorrhage is commonly caused by the bursting of a small sack-shaped or berry-shaped aneurysm. After the hemorrhage, the blood vessels in your brain may widen and narrow erratically (vasospasm), causing brain cell damage by further limiting blood flow. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) A transient ischemic attack (TIA) - sometimes known as a ministroke - is a temporary period of symptoms similar to those you&apos;d have in a stroke. A temporary decrease in blood supply to part of your brain causes TIAs, which may last as little as five minutes. Like an ischemic stroke, a TIA occurs when a clot or debris blocks blood flow to part of your nervous system - but there is no permanent tissue damage and no lasting symptoms. Seek emergency care even if your symptoms seem to clear up. Having a TIA puts you at greater risk of having a full-blown stroke, causing permanent damage later. If you&apos;ve had a TIA, it means there&apos;s likely a partially blocked or narrowed artery leading to your brain or a clot source in the heart. It&apos;s not possible to tell if you&apos;re having a stroke or a TIA based only on your symptoms. Even when symptoms last for under an hour, there is still a risk of permanent tissue damage. Many factors can increase your stroke risk. Some factors can also increase your chances of having a heart attack. Potentially treatable stroke risk factors include: Lifestyle risk factors - Being overweight or obese - Physical inactivity - Heavy or binge drinking - Use of illicit drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamines Medical risk factors - Blood pressure readings higher than 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) - Cigarette smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke - High cholesterol - Diabetes - Obstructive sleep apnea - Cardiovascular disease, including heart failure, heart defects, heart infection or abnormal heart rhythm - Personal or family history of stroke, heart attack or transient ischemic attack. Other factors associated with a higher risk of stroke include: - Age -People age 55 or older have a higher risk of stroke than do younger people. - Race - African-Americans have a higher risk of stroke than do people of other races. - Sex - Men have a higher risk of stroke than women. Women are usually older when they have strokes, and they&apos;re more likely to die of strokes than are men. - Hormones - use of birth control pills or hormone therapies that include estrogen, as well as increased estrogen levels from pregnancy and childbirth. A stroke can sometimes cause temporary or permanent disabilities, depending on how long the brain lacks blood flow and which part was affected. Complications may include: - Paralysis or loss of muscle movement. You may become paralyzed on one side of your body, or lose control of certain muscles, such as those on one side of your face or one arm. Physical therapy may help you return to activities affected by paralysis, such as walking, eating and dressing. - Difficulty talking or swallowing. A stroke might affect control of the muscles in your mouth and throat, making it difficult for you to talk clearly (dysarthria), swallow (dysphagia) or eat. You also may have difficulty with language (aphasia), including speaking or understanding speech, reading, or writing. Therapy with a speech-language pathologist might help. - Memory loss or thinking difficulties. Many people who have had strokes experience some memory loss. Others may have difficulty thinking, making judgments, reasoning and understanding concepts. - Emotional problems. People who have had strokes may have more difficulty controlling their emotions, or they may develop depression. - Pain. Pain, numbness or other strange sensations may occur in the parts of the body affected by stroke. For example, if a stroke causes you to lose feeling in your left arm, you may develop an uncomfortable tingling sensation in that arm. People also may be sensitive to temperature changes, especially extreme cold, after a stroke. This complication is known as central stroke pain or central pain syndrome. This condition generally develops several weeks after a stroke, and it may improve over time. But because the pain is caused by a problem in your brain, rather than a physical injury, there are few treatments. - Changes in behavior and self-care ability. People who have had strokes may become more withdrawn and less social or more impulsive. They may need help with grooming and daily chores. As with any brain injury, the success of treating these complications varies from person to person. To determine the most appropriate treatment for your stroke, your emergency team needs to evaluate the type of stroke you&apos;re having and the areas of your brain affected by the stroke. They also need to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, such as a brain tumor or a drug reaction. Your doctor may use several tests to determine your risk of stroke, including: - Physical examination. Your doctor will ask you or a family member what symptoms you&apos;ve been having, when they started and what you were doing when they began. Your doctor then will evaluate whether these symptoms are still present. Your doctor will want to know what medications you take and whether you have experienced any head injuries. You&apos;ll be asked about your personal and family history of heart disease, transient ischemic attack and stroke. Your doctor will check your blood pressure and use a stethoscope to listen to your heart and to listen for a whooshing sound (bruit) over your neck (carotid) arteries, which may indicate atherosclerosis. Your doctor may also use an ophthalmoscope to check for signs of tiny cholesterol crystals or clots in the blood vessels at the back of your eyes. - Blood tests. You may have several blood tests, which tell your care team how fast your blood clots, whether your blood sugar is abnormally high or low, whether critical blood chemicals are out of balance, or whether you may have an infection. Managing your blood&apos;s clotting time and levels of sugar and other key chemicals will be part of your stroke care. - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses a series of X-rays to create a detailed image of your brain. A CT scan can show a hemorrhage, tumor, stroke and other conditions. Doctors may inject a dye into your bloodstream to view your blood vessels in your neck and brain in greater detail (computerized tomography angiography). There are different types of CT scans that your doctor may use depending on your situation. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses powerful radio waves and magnets to create a detailed view of your brain. An MRI can detect brain tissue damaged by an ischemic stroke and brain hemorrhages. Your doctor may inject a dye into a blood vessel to view the arteries and veins and highlight blood flow (magnetic resonance angiography, or magnetic resonance venography). - Carotid ultrasound. In this test, sound waves create detailed images of the inside of the carotid arteries in your neck. This test shows buildup of fatty deposits (plaques) and blood flow in your carotid arteries. - Cerebral angiogram. In this test, your doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube (catheter) through a small incision, usually in your groin, and guides it through your major arteries and into your carotid or vertebral artery. Then your doctor injects a dye into your blood vessels to make them visible under X-ray imaging. This procedure gives a detailed view of arteries in your brain and neck. - Echocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to create detailed images of your heart. An echocardiogram can find a source of clots in your heart that may have traveled from your heart to your brain and caused your stroke. You may have a transesophageal echocardiogram. In this test, your doctor inserts a flexible tube with a small device (transducer) attached into your throat and down into the tube that connects the back of your mouth to your stomach (esophagus). Because your esophagus is directly behind your heart, a transesophageal echocardiogram can create clear, detailed ultrasound images of your heart and any blood clots. Emergency treatment for stroke depends on whether you&apos;re having an ischemic stroke blocking an artery - the most common kind - or a hemorrhagic stroke that involves bleeding into the brain. Ischemic stroke To treat an ischemic stroke, doctors must quickly restore blood flow to your brain. Emergency treatment with medications. Therapy with clot-busting drugs must start within 4.5 hours if they are given into the vein - and the sooner, the better. Quick treatment not only improves your chances of survival but also may reduce complications. You may be given: - Intravenous injection of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). This injection of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), also called alteplase, is considered the gold standard treatment for ischemic stroke. An injection of tPA is usually given through a vein in the arm. This potent clot-busting drug ideally is given within three hours. In some instances, tPA can be given up to 4.5 hours after stroke symptoms begin. This drug restores blood flow by dissolving the blood clot causing your stroke, and it may help people who have had strokes recover more fully. Your doctor will consider certain risks, such as potential bleeding in the brain, to determine if tPA is appropriate for you. Emergency endovascular procedures. Doctors sometimes treat ischemic strokes with procedures performed directly inside the blocked blood vessel. These procedures must be performed as soon as possible, depending on features of the blood clot: - Medications delivered directly to the brain. Doctors may insert a long, thin tube (catheter) through an artery in your groin and thread it to your brain to deliver tPA directly into the area where the stroke is occurring. This is called intra-arterial thrombolysis. The time window for this treatment is somewhat longer than for intravenous tPA, but is still limited. - Removing the clot with a stent retriever. Doctors may use a catheter to maneuver a device into the blocked blood vessel in your brain and trap and remove the clot. This procedure is particularly beneficial for people with large clots that can&apos;t be completely dissolved with tPA, though this procedure is often performed in combination with intravenous tPA. Several large and recent studies suggest that, depending on the location of the clot and other factors, endovascular therapy might be the most effective treatment. Endovascular therapy has been shown to significantly improve outcomes and reduce long-term disability after ischemic stroke. Other procedures. To decrease your risk of having another stroke or transient ischemic attack, your doctor may recommend a procedure to open up an artery that&apos;s narrowed by plaque. Doctors sometimes recommend the following procedures to prevent a stroke. Options will vary depending on your situation: - Carotid endarterectomy. In a carotid endarterectomy, a surgeon removes plaques from arteries that run along each side of your neck to your brain (carotid arteries). In this procedure, your surgeon makes an incision along the front of your neck, opens your carotid artery and removes plaque that blocks the carotid artery. Your surgeon then repairs the artery with stitches or a patch made from a vein or artificial material (graft). The procedure may reduce your risk of ischemic stroke. However, a carotid endarterectomy also involves risks, especially for people with heart disease or other medical conditions. - Angioplasty and stents. In an angioplasty, a surgeon usually accesses your carotid arteries through an artery in your groin. Here, your surgeon can gently and safely navigate to the carotid arteries in your neck. A balloon is then inflated to expand the narrowed artery. Then a stent can be inserted to support the opened artery. Hemorrhagic stroke Emergency treatment of hemorrhagic stroke focuses on controlling your bleeding and reducing pressure in your brain. You might also need surgery to help reduce future risk. Emergency measures. If you take warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) or anti-platelet drugs such as clopidogrel (Plavix) to prevent blood clots, you may be given drugs or transfusions of blood products to counteract the blood thinners&apos; effects. You may also be given drugs to lower pressure in your brain (intracranial pressure), lower your blood pressure, prevent vasospasm or prevent seizures. Once the bleeding in your brain stops, treatment usually involves supportive medical care while your body absorbs the blood. Healing is similar to what happens while a bad bruise goes away. If the area of bleeding is large, your doctor may perform surgery to remove the blood and relieve pressure on your brain. Surgical blood vessel repair. Surgery may be used to repair blood vessel abnormalities associated with hemorrhagic strokes. Your doctor may recommend one of these procedures after a stroke or if an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or other type of vascular malformation caused your hemorrhagic stroke: - Surgical clipping. A surgeon places a tiny clamp at the base of the aneurysm, to stop blood flow to it. This clamp can keep the aneurysm from bursting, or it can prevent re-bleeding of an aneurysm that has recently hemorrhaged. - Coiling (endovascular embolization). A surgeon inserts a catheter into an artery in your groin and guides it to your brain using X-ray imaging. Tiny detachable coils are guided into the aneurysm (aneurysm coiling). The coils fill the aneurysm, which blocks blood flow into the aneurysm and causes the blood to clot. - Surgical AVM removal. Surgeons may remove a smaller AVM if it&apos;s located in an accessible area of your brain, to eliminate the risk of rupture and lower the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. However, it&apos;s not always possible to remove an AVM if its removal would cause too large a reduction in brain function, or if it&apos;s large or located deep within your brain. - Stereotactic radiosurgery. Using multiple beams of highly focused radiation, stereotactic radiosurgery is an advanced minimally invasive treatment used to repair vascular malformations. Stroke recovery and rehabilitation After emergency treatment, stroke care focuses on helping you recover as much function as possible and return to independent living. The impact of your stroke depends on the area of the brain involved and the amount of tissue damaged. If your stroke affected the right side of your brain, your movement and sensation on the left side of your body may be affected. If your stroke damaged the brain tissue on the left side of your brain, your movement and sensation on the right side of your body may be affected. Brain damage to the left side of your brain may cause speech and language disorders. In addition, if you&apos;ve had a stroke, you may have problems with breathing, swallowing, balancing and vision. Most stroke survivors receive treatment in a rehabilitation program. Your doctor will recommend the most rigorous therapy program you can handle based on your age, overall health and degree of disability from your stroke. Your doctor will take into consideration your lifestyle, interests and priorities, and the availability of family members or other caregivers. Your rehabilitation program may begin before you leave the hospital. After discharge, you might continue your program in a rehabilitation unit of the same hospital, another rehabilitation unit or skilled nursing facility, an outpatient unit, or your home. Every person&apos;s stroke recovery is different. Depending on your condition, your treatment team may include: - Doctor trained in brain conditions (neurologist) - Rehabilitation doctor (physiatrist) - Nurse - Dietitian - Physical therapist - Occupational therapist - Recreational therapist - Speech pathologist - Social worker - Case manager - Psychologist or psychiatrist - Chaplain One way to evaluate the care of patients diagnosed with stroke is to look at the percentage of patients receiving the timely and effective care measures that are appropriate. The goal is 100 percent. The graph below displays the percentage of eligible Mayo Clinic patients diagnosed with stroke receiving all of the appropriate care measures.

				<AnswerText>Stroke (What Is a Stroke?): A stroke happens when something changes how blood flows through the brain. Blood brings oxygen and nutrients to brain cells. If blood can&apos;t flow to a part of the brain, cells that do not receive enough oxygen suffer and eventually die. If brain cells are without oxygen for only a short time, they can sometimes get better. But brain cells that have died can&apos;t be brought back to life. So, someone who has had a stroke may have trouble speaking, thinking, or walking.There are two major types of stroke. The most common kind, ischemic, is caused by a blood clot or the narrowing of a blood vessel (an artery) leading to the brain. This keeps blood from flowing into other parts of the brain and keeps needed oxygen and nutrients from reaching brain cells. Blockages that cause ischemic strokes stem from three conditions:- Formation of a clot within a blood vessel of the brain or neck, called thrombosis - Movement of a clot from another part of the body, such as from the heart to the neck or brain, called an embolism - Severe narrowing of an artery (stenosis) in or leading to the brain, due to fatty deposits lining the blood vessel wallsIn the second major kind of stroke, hemorrhagic, a broken blood vessel causes bleeding in the brain. This break in the vessel also stops oxygen and nutrients from reaching brain cells.Sometimes the symptoms of a stroke last only a few minutes and then go away. That could be a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a mini-stroke. A TIA is a medical emergency. You should get medical help right away. If a TIA is not treated quickly, it could be followed within hours or days by a major disabling stroke.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ischemic Stroke (Summary): Summary A stroke is a medical emergency. There are two types - ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke is the most common type. It is usually caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This keeps blood from flowing to the brain. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. Another cause is stenosis, or narrowing of the artery. This can happen because of atherosclerosis, a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) occur when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted briefly. Having a TIA can mean you are at risk for having a more serious stroke. Symptoms of stroke are - Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body) - Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech - Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes - Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination - Sudden severe headache with no known cause It is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. Blood thinners may be used to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot. Post-stroke rehabilitation can help people overcome disabilities caused by stroke damage.

				<AnswerText>What causes Stroke?: Ischemic Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack An ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurs if an artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked. Many medical conditions can increase the risk of ischemic stroke or TIA. For example, atherosclerosis (ath-er-o-skler-O-sis) is a disease in which a fatty substance called plaque builds up on the inner walls of the arteries. Plaque hardens and narrows the arteries, which limits the flow of blood to tissues and organs (such as the heart and brain). Plaque in an artery can crack or rupture (break open). Blood platelets (PLATE-lets), which are disc-shaped cell fragments, stick to the site of the plaque injury and clump together to form blood clots. These clots can partly or fully block an artery. Plaque can build up in any artery in the body, including arteries in the heart, brain, and neck. The two main arteries on each side of the neck are called the carotid (ka-ROT-id) arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to the brain, face, scalp, and neck. When plaque builds up in the carotid arteries, the condition is called carotid artery disease. Carotid artery disease causes many of the ischemic strokes and TIAs that occur in the United States. An embolic stroke (a type of ischemic stroke) or TIA also can occur if a blood clot or piece of plaque breaks away from the wall of an artery. The clot or plaque can travel through the bloodstream and get stuck in one of the brains arteries. This stops blood flow through the artery and damages brain cells. Heart conditions and blood disorders also can cause blood clots that can lead to a stroke or TIA. For example, atrial fibrillation (A-tre-al fi-bri-LA-shun), or AF, is a common cause of embolic stroke. In AF, the upper chambers of the heart contract in a very fast and irregular way. As a result, some blood pools in the heart. The pooling increases the risk of blood clots forming in the heart chambers. An ischemic stroke or TIA also can occur because of lesions caused by atherosclerosis. These lesions may form in the small arteries of the brain, and they can block blood flow to the brain. Hemorrhagic Stroke Sudden bleeding in the brain can cause a hemorrhagic stroke. The bleeding causes swelling of the brain and increased pressure in the skull. The swelling and pressure damage brain cells and tissues. Examples of conditions that can cause a hemorrhagic stroke include high blood pressure, aneurysms, and arteriovenous (ar-TEER-e-o-VE-nus) malformations (AVMs). &quot;Blood pressure&quot; is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps blood. If blood pressure rises and stays high over time, it can damage the body in many ways. Aneurysms are balloon-like bulges in an artery that can stretch and burst. AVMs are tangles of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture within the brain. High blood pressure can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in people who have aneurysms or AVMs.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Recovering after stroke (Information): WHERE TO LIVE AFTER A STROKE Most people will need stroke rehabilitation (rehab) to help them recover after they leave the hospital. Stroke rehab will help you regain the ability to care for yourself. Most types of therapy can be done where you live, including in the home. - People who are not able to care for themselves at home after a stroke may have therapy in a special part of a hospital or in a nursing or rehabilitation center. - Those who are able to go back home might go to a special clinic or have someone come to their home. Whether you can go back home after a stroke depends on: - Whether you can take care of yourself - How much help there will be at home - Whether the home is a safe place (for example, stairs in the home might not be safe for a stroke patient who has trouble walking) You may need to go to a boarding home or convalescent home to have a safe environment. For people who are cared for at home: - Changes may be needed to stay safe from falls in the home and bathroom, prevent wandering, and make the home easier to use. The bed and bathroom should be easy to reach. Items (such as throw rugs) that may cause a fall should be removed. - A number of devices can help with activities such as cooking or eating, bathing or showering, moving around the home or elsewhere, dressing and grooming, writing and using a computer, and many more activities. - Family counseling may help you cope with the changes needed for home care. Visiting nurses or aides, volunteer services, homemakers, adult protective services, adult day care, and other community resources (such as a local Department of Aging) may be helpful. - Legal advice may be needed. Advance directives, power of attorney, and other legal actions may make it easier to make decisions about care. SPEAKING AND COMMUNICATING After a stroke, some people may have problems finding a word or being able to speak more than one word or phrase at a time. Or, they may have trouble speaking at all. This is called aphasia. - People who have had a stroke may be able to put many words together, but they may not make sense. Many people do not know that what they are saying is not easy to understand. They may get frustrated when they realize other people cannot understand. Family and caregivers should learn how to best help communicate. - It can take up to 2 years to recover speech. Not everyone will fully recover. A stroke can also damage the muscles that help you speak. As a result, these muscles do not move the right way when you try to speak. A speech and language therapist can work with you and your family or caregivers. You can learn new ways to communicate. THINKING AND MEMORY After a stroke, people may have: - Changes in their ability to think or reason - Changes in behavior and sleep patterns - Memory problems - Poor judgment These changes may lead to: - An increase in the need for safety measures - Changes in ability to drive - Other changes or precauations Depression after a stroke is common. Depression can start soon after a stroke, but symptoms may not begin for up to 2 years after the stroke. Treatments for depression include: - Increased social activity. More visits in the home or going to an adult day care center for activities. - Medicines for depression and visits to a therapist or counselor MUSCLE, JOINT, AND NERVE PROBLEMS Moving around and doing normal daily tasks such as dressing and feeding may be harder after a stroke. Muscles on one side of the body may be weaker or may not move at all. This may involve only part of the arm or leg, or the whole side of the body. - Muscles on the weak side of the body may be very tight. - Different joints and muscles in the body may become hard to move. The shoulder and other joints may dislocate. Many of these problems can cause pain after a stroke. Pain may also occur from changes in the brain itself. You may use pain medicines, but check with your health care provider first. People who have pain due to tight muscles may get medicines that help with muscle spasms. Physical therapists, occupational therapists, and rehabilitation doctors will help you relearn how to: - Dress, groom, and eat - Bathe, shower, and use the toilet - Use canes, walkers, wheelchairs, and other devices to stay as mobile as possible - Possibly return to work - Keep all of the muscles as strong as possible and stay as physically active as possible, even if you cannot walk - Manage muscle spasms or tightness with stretching exercises and braces that fit around the ankle, elbow, shoulder, and other joints BLADDER AND BOWEL CARE A stroke can lead to problems with bladder or bowel control. These problems may be caused by: - Damage to part of the brain that helps the bowels and bladder work smoothly - Not noticing the need to go to the bathroom - Problems getting to the toilet in time Symptoms may include: - Loss of bowel control, diarrhea (loose bowel movements), or constipation (hard bowel movements) - Loss of bladder control, feeling the need to urinate often, or problems emptying the bladder Your provider may prescribe medicines to help with bladder control. You may need a referral to a bladder or bowel specialist. Sometimes, a bladder or bowel schedule will help. It can also help to place a commode chair close to where you sit most of the day. Some people need a permanent urinary catheter to drain urine from their body. To prevent skin or pressure sores: - Clean up after incontinence - Change position often and know how to move in a bed, chair, or wheelchair - Make sure the wheelchair fits correctly - Have family members or other caregivers learn how to watch out for skin sores SWALLOWING AND EATING AFTER A STROKE Swallowing problems may be due to a lack of attention when eating or damage to the nerves that help you swallow. Symptoms of swallowing problems are: - Coughing or choking, either during or after eating - Gurgling sounds from the throat during or after eating - Throat clearing after drinking or swallowing - Slow chewing or eating - Coughing food back up after eating - Hiccups after swallowing - Chest discomfort during or after swallowing A speech therapist can help with swallowing and eating problems after a stroke. Diet changes, such as thickening liquids or eating pureed foods, may be needed. Some people will need a permanent feeding tube, called a gastrostomy. Some people do not take in enough calories after a stroke. High-calorie foods or food supplements that also contain vitamins or minerals can prevent weight loss and keep you healthy. OTHER IMPORTANT ISSUES Both men and women may have problems with sexual function after a stroke. Medicines called phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (Viagra or Cialis) may be helpful. Ask your provider whether these drugs are right for you. Talking with a therapist or counselor may also help. Treatment and lifestyle changes to prevent another stroke are important. This includes healthy eating, controlling illnesses such as diabetes and high blood pressure, and sometimes taking medicine to help prevent stroke.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Stroke (Outlook (Prognosis)): How well a person does after a stroke depends on: - The type of stroke - How much brain tissue is damaged - What body functions have been affected - How quickly treatment is given Problems moving, thinking, and talking often improve in the weeks to months after a stroke. Many people who have had a stroke will keep improving in the months or years after their stroke. Over half of people who have a stroke are able to function and live at home. Others are not able to care for themselves. If treatment with clot-busting drugs is successful, the symptoms of a stroke may go away. However, people often do not get to the hospital soon enough to receive these drugs, or they cannot take these drugs because of a health condition. People who have a stroke from a blood clot (ischemic stroke) have a better chance of surviving than those who have a stroke from bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). The risk for a second stroke is highest during the weeks or months after the first stroke. The risk begins to decrease after this period.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Stroke (Treatment): Generally there are three treatment stages for stroke: prevention, therapy immediately after the stroke, and post-stroke rehabilitation. Therapies to prevent a first or recurrent stroke are based on treating an individual&apos;s underlying risk factors for stroke, such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes. Acute stroke therapies try to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot causing an ischemic stroke or by stopping the bleeding of a hemorrhagic stroke. Post-stroke rehabilitation helps individuals overcome disabilities that result from stroke damage. Medication or drug therapy is the most common treatment for stroke. The most popular classes of drugs used to prevent or treat stroke are antithrombotics (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) and thrombolytics.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Stroke: A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly interrupted or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, spilling blood into the spaces surrounding brain cells. Brain cells die when they no longer receive oxygen and nutrients from the blood or there is sudden bleeding into or around the brain. The symptoms of a stroke include sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body; sudden confusion or trouble speaking or understanding speech; sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes; sudden trouble with walking, dizziness, or loss of balance or coordination; or sudden severe headache with no known cause. There are two forms of stroke: ischemic - blockage of a blood vessel supplying the brain, and hemorrhagic - bleeding into or around the brain. Generally there are three treatment stages for stroke: prevention, therapy immediately after the stroke, and post-stroke rehabilitation. Therapies to prevent a first or recurrent stroke are based on treating an individual&apos;s underlying risk factors for stroke, such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes. Acute stroke therapies try to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot causing an ischemic stroke or by stopping the bleeding of a hemorrhagic stroke. Post-stroke rehabilitation helps individuals overcome disabilities that result from stroke damage. Medication or drug therapy is the most common treatment for stroke. The most popular classes of drugs used to prevent or treat stroke are antithrombotics (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) and thrombolytics. Although stroke is a disease of the brain, it can affect the entire body. A common disability that results from stroke is complete paralysis on one side of the body, called hemiplegia. A related disability that is not as debilitating as paralysis is one-sided weakness or hemiparesis. Stroke may cause problems with thinking, awareness, attention, learning, judgment, and memory. Stroke survivors often have problems understanding or forming speech. A stroke can lead to emotional problems. Stroke patients may have difficulty controlling their emotions or may express inappropriate emotions. Many stroke patients experience depression. Stroke survivors may also have numbness or strange sensations. The pain is often worse in the hands and feet and is made worse by movement and temperature changes, especially cold temperatures. Recurrent stroke is frequent; about 25 percent of people who recover from their first stroke will have another stroke within 5 years.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What are the symptoms of Stroke?: The signs and symptoms of a stroke often develop quickly. However, they can develop over hours or even days. The type of symptoms depends on the type of stroke and the area of the brain thats affected. How long symptoms last and how severe they are vary among different people. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include: Sudden weakness Paralysis (an inability to move) or numbness of the face, arms, or legs, especially on one side of the body Confusion Trouble speaking or understanding speech Trouble seeing in one or both eyes Problems breathing Dizziness, trouble walking, loss of balance or coordination, and unexplained falls Loss of consciousness Sudden and severe headache A transient ischemic attack (TIA) has the same signs and symptoms as a stroke. However, TIA symptoms usually last less than 12 hours (although they may last up to 24 hours). A TIA may occur only once in a persons lifetime or more often. At first, it may not be possible to tell whether someone is having a TIA or stroke. All stroke-like symptoms require medical care. If you think you or someone else is having a TIA or stroke, call 911 right away. Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. During a stroke, every minute counts. Stroke Complications After youve had a stroke, you may develop other complications, such as: Blood clots and muscle weakness. Being immobile (unable to move around) for a long time can raise your risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs. Being immobile also can lead to muscle weakness and decreased muscle flexibility. Problems swallowing and pneumonia. If a stroke affects the muscles used for swallowing, you may have a hard time eating or drinking. You also may be at risk of inhaling food or drink into your lungs. If this happens, you may develop pneumonia. Loss of bladder control. Some strokes affect the muscles used to urinate. You may need a urinary catheter (a tube placed into the bladder) until you can urinate on your own. Use of these catheters can lead to urinary tract infections. Loss of bowel control or constipation also may occur after a stroke.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Warning signs and symptoms of heart disease: Heart disease often develops over time. You may have early signs or symptoms long before you have serious heart problems. Or you may not realize you are developing heart disease. The warning signs of heart disease may not be obvious. Also, not every person has the same symptoms. Certain symptoms, such as chest pain, ankle swelling, and shortness of breath may be signals that something is wrong. Learning the warning signs can help you get treatment and help prevent a heart attack or stroke. Chest pain is discomfort or pain that you feel along the front of your body, between your neck and upper abdomen. There are many causes of chest pain that have nothing to do with your heart. But chest pain is still the most common symptom of poor blood flow to the heart or a heart attack. This type of chest pain is called angina. Chest pain can occur when the heart is not getting enough blood or oxygen. The amount and type of pain can vary from person to person. The intensity of the pain does not always relate to how severe the problem is. - Some people may feel a crushing pain, while others feel only mild discomfort. - Your chest may feel heavy or like someone is squeezing your heart. You may also feel a sharp, burning pain in your chest. - You may feel the pain under your breastbone (sternum), or in your neck, arms, stomach, jaw, or upper back. - Chest pain from angina often occurs with activity or emotion, and goes away with rest or a medicine called nitroglycerin. - Bad indigestion can also cause chest pain. Women, older adults, and people with diabetes may have little or no chest pain. They are more likely to have symptoms other than chest pain, such as: - Fatigue - Shortness of breath - General weakness - Change in skin color or greyish pallor (episodes of change in skin color associated with weakness) Other symptoms of a heart attack can include: - Extreme anxiety - Fainting or loss of consciousness - Lightheadedness or dizziness - Nausea or vomiting - Palpitations (feeling like your heart is beating too fast or irregularly) - Shortness of breath - Sweating, which may be very heavy When the heart can&apos;t pump blood as well as it should, blood backs up in the veins that go from the lungs to the heart. Fluid leaks into the lungs and causes shortness of breath. This is a symptom of heart failure. You may notice shortness of breath: - During activity - While you&apos;re resting - When you&apos;re lying flat on your back -- it may even wake you from sleep Coughing or wheezing that doesn&apos;t go away can be another sign that fluid is building up in your lungs. You may also cough up mucus that is pink or bloody. Swelling (edema) in your lower legs is another sign of a heart problem. When your heart doesn&apos;t work as well, blood flow slows and backs up in the veins in your legs. This causes fluid to build up in your tissues. You may also have swelling in your stomach or notice some weight gain. Narrowing of the blood vessels that bring blood to other parts of the body may mean you have a much higher risk for heart attack. It can occur when cholesterol and other fatty material (plaque) build up on the walls of your arteries. Poor blood supply to the legs may lead to: - Pain, achiness, fatigue, burning, or discomfort in the muscles of your feet, calves, or thighs. - Symptoms that often appear during walking or exercise, and go away after several minutes of rest. - Numbness in your legs or feet when you are at rest. Your legs may also feel cool to the touch, and the skin may look pale. A stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain stops. A stroke is sometimes called a &quot;brain attack.&quot; Symptoms of stroke can include difficulty moving the limbs on one side of your body, one side of the face drooping, difficulty with speaking or understanding language. Tiredness can have many causes. Often it simply means that you need more rest. But feeling run down can be a sign of a more serious problem. Fatigue may be a sign of heart trouble when: - You feel much more tired than normal. It&apos;s common for women to feel severely tired before or during a heart attack. - You feel so tired that you can&apos;t do your normal daily activities. - You have sudden, severe weakness. If your heart can&apos;t pump blood as well, it may beat faster to try to keep up. You may feel your heart racing or throbbing. A fast or uneven heartbeat can also be the sign of an arrhythmia. This is a problem with your heart rate or rhythm. If you have any signs of heart disease, call your health care provider right away. Don&apos;t wait to see if the symptoms go away or dismiss them as nothing. Call your local emergency number (such as 911) if: - You have chest pain or other symptoms of a heart attack - If you know you have angina and have chest pain that doesn&apos;t go away after 5 minutes of rest or after taking nitroglycerine - If you think you may be having a heart attack - If you become extremely short of breath - If you think you may have lost consciousness Updated by: Michael A.

				<AnswerText>What are the symptoms of Stroke?: Know the Signs Knowing the warning signs of stroke and controlling stroke&apos;s risk factors can lower your risk of death or disability. If you suffer a stroke, you may not realize it at first. The people around you might not know it, either. Your family, friends, or neighbors may think you are unaware or confused. You may not be able to call 911 on your own. That&apos;s why everyone should know the signs of stroke and know how to act fast. Warning signs are clues your body sends to tell you that your brain is not receiving enough oxygen. If you observe one or more of the following signs of a stroke or &quot;brain attack,&quot; don&apos;t wait. Call 911 right away! Common Signs of Stroke These are warning signs of a stroke: - sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body - sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding - sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes - sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination - sudden severe headache with no known cause. sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination sudden severe headache with no known cause. Other danger signs that may occur include double vision, drowsiness, and nausea or vomiting. Don&apos;t Ignore &quot;Mini-Strokes&quot; Sometimes the warning signs of stroke may last only a few moments and then disappear. These brief episodes, known as transient ischemic attacks or TIAs, are sometimes called &quot;mini-strokes.&quot; Although brief, TIAs identify an underlying serious condition that isn&apos;t going away without medical help. Unfortunately, since they clear up, many people ignore them. Don&apos;t ignore them. Heeding them can save your life. Why It&apos;s Important To Act Fast Stroke is a medical emergency. Every minute counts when someone is having a stroke. The longer blood flow is cut off to the brain, the greater the damage. Immediate treatment can save peoples lives and enhance their chances for successful recovery. Ischemic strokes, the most common type of strokes, can be treated with a drug called t-PA that dissolves blood clots obstructing blood flow to the brain. The window of opportunity to start treating stroke patients is three hours, but to be evaluated and receive treatment, patients need to get to the hospital within 60 minutes. What Should You Do? Don&apos;t wait for the symptoms of stroke to improve or worsen. If you believe you are having a stroke, call 911 immediately. Making the decision to call for medical help can make the difference in avoiding a lifelong disability and in greatly improving your chances for recovery. If you observe someone having a stroke if he or she suddenly loses the ability to speak, or move an arm or leg on one side, or experiences facial paralysis on one side call 911 immediately.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Myopathy with extrapyramidal signs: Myopathy with extrapyramidal signs is a disorder characterized by early childhood onset of proximal muscle weakness (muscles closest to the body’s midline) and learning disabilities. The muscle weakness does not progress, but most patients develop progressive atypical involuntary muscle contractions that influence gait, movement, and posture (extrapyramidal signs) that may be disabling. Signs and symptoms are variable and include brief, repetitive, jerky and uncontrolled movements caused by muscle contractions ( chorea), tremor, abnormal posturing, and involuntary repetitive movements of the mouth and face. [1]  Other symptoms may include uncoordinated movements ( ataxia ), a very small head ( microcephaly ), drooping of the eyelids, wasting of the eye nerve ( optic atrophy), and axonal peripheral neuropathy.

				<AnswerText>Headaches - danger signs: A headache is a pain or discomfort in the head, scalp, or neck. Common types of headaches include tension headaches, migraine or cluster headaches, sinus headaches, and headaches that begin in your neck. You may have a mild headache with a cold, the flu, or other viral illnesses when you also have a low fever. Most people with headaches feel better by making lifestyle changes, such as learning ways to relax. Taking certain medicines, such as pain medicine, may also help. Problems with blood vessels and bleeding in the brain can cause a headache. These problems include: - Abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in the brain that usually forms before birth. This problem is called an arteriovenous malformation, or AVM. - Blood flow to part of the brain stops. This is called a stroke. - Weakening of the wall of a blood vessel that can break open and bleed into the brain. This is known as a brain aneurysm. - Bleeding in the area between the brain and the thin tissue that covers the brain. This is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Other causes of headaches that should be checked by a health care provider right away include: - Blood pressure that is very high - Brain tumor - Buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling (hydrocephalus) - Buildup of pressure inside the skull that appears to be, but is not, a tumor (pseudotumor cerebri) - Carbon monoxide poisoning - Infection in the brain or the tissue that surrounds the brain, as well as a brain abscess - Swollen, inflamed artery that supplies blood to part of the head, temple, and neck area (temporal arteritis) If you cannot see your provider right away, go to the emergency room or call 911 if: - This is the first severe headache you have ever had in your life and it interferes with your daily activities. - You develop a headache right after activities such as weightlifting, aerobics, jogging, or sex. - Your headache comes on suddenly and is explosive or violent. - Your headache is &quot;the worst ever,&quot; even if you regularly get headaches. - You also have slurred speech, a change in vision, problems moving your arms or legs, loss of balance, confusion, or memory loss with your headache. - Your headache gets worse over 24 hours. - You also have fever, stiff neck, nausea, and vomiting with your headache. - Your headache occurs with a head injury. - Your headache is severe and just in 1 eye, with redness in that eye. - You just started getting headaches, especially if your are older than 50. - You have headaches along with vision problems and pain while chewing, or weight loss. - You have a history of cancer and develop a new headache. - Your immune system is weakened by disease (such as HIV infection) or by medicines (such as chemotherapy drugs and steroids). See your provider soon if: - Your headaches wake you up from sleep. - A headache lasts more than a few days. - Headaches are worse in the morning. - You have a history of headaches but they have changed in pattern or intensity . - You have headaches often and there is no known cause.

				<AnswerText>Common symptoms during pregnancy: Growing a baby is hard work. Your body will go through a lot of changes as your baby grows and your hormones change. Along with the aches and pains of pregnancy, you will feel other new or changing symptoms. Even so, many pregnant women say that they feel healthier than ever. Being tired is common during pregnancy. Most women feel tired the first few months, then again toward the end. Exercise, rest, and a proper diet can make you feel less tired. It may also help to take rest breaks or naps every day. Early on in the pregnancy, you will likely be making more trips to the bathroom. - As your uterus grows and rises higher in your abdomen (belly), the need to urinate often may lessen. - Even so, you will continue to urinate more throughout pregnancy. That means that you also need to drink more water, and may be thirstier than before you were pregnant. - As you get closer to delivery and your baby descends into your pelvis, you will need to pee much more, and the amount of urine passed at one time will be less (the bladder holds less due to pressure from the baby). If you have pain when you urinate or a change in urine odor or color, call your health care provider. These could be signs of a bladder infection. Some pregnant women also leak urine when they cough or sneeze. For most women, this goes away after the baby is born. If this happens to you, start doing Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles of your pelvic floor. You may see more vaginal discharge while pregnant. Call your provider if the discharge: - Has a foul odor - Has a greenish color - Makes you feel itchy - Causes pain or soreness Having a hard time moving the bowels is normal during pregnancy. This is because: - Hormone changes during pregnancy slow down your digestive system. - Later in your pregnancy, the pressure from your uterus on your rectum may also worsen the problem. You can ease constipation by: - Eating raw fruits and vegetables, such as prunes, to get extra fiber. - Eating whole grain or bran cereals for more fiber. - Using a fiber supplement regularly. - Drinking plenty of water (8 to 9 cups daily). Ask your provider about trying a stool softener. Also ask before using laxatives during pregnancy. While you are pregnant, food stays in your stomach and bowels longer. This may cause heartburn (stomach acid moving back up into the esophagus). You can reduce heartburn by: - Eating small meals - Avoiding spicy and greasy foods - Not drinking large amounts of liquid before bedtime - Not exercising for at least 2 hours after you eat - Not lying down flat right after a meal If you continue to have heartburn, talk to your provider about medicines that can help. Some women have nose and gum bleeding while they are pregnant. This is because the tissues in their nose and gums get dry, and the blood vessels dilate and are closer to the surface. You can avoid or reduce this bleeding by: - Drinking lots of fluids - Getting lots of vitamin C, from orange juice or other fruits and juices - Using a humidifier (a device that puts water in the air) to decrease dryness of the nose or sinuses - Brushing your teeth with a soft toothbrush to decrease bleeding gums - Maintaining good dental hygiene and using floss every day to keep your gums healthy Swelling in your legs is common. You may see more swelling as you get closer to giving birth. The swelling is caused by your uterus pressing on the veins. - You may also notice that the veins in your lower body are becoming larger. - In the legs, these are called varicose veins. - You may also have veins close to your vulva and vagina that swell. - In your rectum, veins that swell are called hemorrhoids. To reduce swelling: - Raise your legs and rest your feet on a surface higher than your belly. - Lie on your side in bed. Lying on the left side is better if you can do it comfortably. It also provides better circulation for the baby. - Wear support pantyhose or compression stockings. - Limit salty foods. Salt works like a sponge and makes your body hold more water. - Try not to strain during bowel movements. This can worsen hemorrhoids. Leg swelling that occurs with headaches or high blood pressure can be a sign of a serious medical complication of pregnancy called preeclampsia. It is important to discuss leg swelling with your provider. Some women feel short of breath at times while they are pregnant. It happens more often in the early part of the pregnancy due to the changes in your hormones. It may also happen again toward the end of your pregnancy because of pressure from the baby. Mild shortness of breath from exercise that quickly gets better is not serious. Severe chest pain or shortness of breath that does not go away can be a sign of a serious medical complication. Call 911 or go to an emergency room right away if you have these symptoms. You may get short of breath again in the later weeks of pregnancy. This is because the uterus takes up so much room that your lungs do not have as much space to expand. Doing these things might help with shortness of breath: - Sitting up straight - Sleeping propped up on a pillow - Resting when you feel short of breath - Moving at a slower pace If you suddenly have a hard time breathing that is unusual for you, see your provider right away or go to the emergency room.

				<AnswerText>Stroke (Treatment): A stroke is a medical emergency. Quick treatment is needed. Call 9-1-1 or your local emergency number right away or seek urgent medical care at the first signs of a stroke. People who are having stroke symptoms need to get to a hospital as quickly as possible. - If the stroke is caused by a blood clot, a clot-busting drug may be given to dissolve the clot. - To be effective, this treatment must be started within 3 to 4 1/2 hours of when the symptoms first started. The sooner this treatment is started, the better the chance of a good outcome. Other treatments given in the hospital depend on the cause of the stroke. These may include: - Blood thinners such as heparin, warfarin (Coumadin), aspirin, or clopidogrel (Plavix) - Medicine to control risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol - Special procedures or surgery to relieve symptoms or prevent more strokes - Nutrients and fluids Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and swallowing therapy will all begin in the hospital. If the person has severe swallowing problems, a feeding tube in the stomach (gastrostomy tube) will likely be needed. The goal of treatment after a stroke is to help you recover as much function as possible and prevent future strokes. Recovery from your stroke will begin while you are still in the hospital or at a rehabilitation center. It will continue when you go home from the hospital or center. Be sure to follow up with your health care provider after you go home.</AnswerText>

Strokes and TIAs are medical emergencies. If you have stroke symptoms, call 911 right away. Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin lifesaving treatment on the way to the emergency room. During a stroke, every minute counts. Once you receive immediate treatment, your doctor will try to treat your stroke risk factors and prevent complications by recommending heart-healthy lifestyle changes. Treating an Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack An ischemic stroke or TIA occurs if an artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked. Often, blood clots cause the blockages that lead to ischemic strokes and TIAs. Treatment for an ischemic stroke or TIA may include medicines and medical procedures. Medicines If you have a stroke caused by a blood clot, you may be given a clot-dissolving, or clot-busting, medication called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). A doctor will inject tPA into a vein in your arm. This type of medication must be given within 4hours of symptom onset. Ideally, it should be given as soon as possible. The sooner treatment begins, the better your chances of recovery. Thus, its important to know the signs and symptoms of a stroke and to call 911 right away for emergency care. If you cant have tPA for medical reasons, your doctor may give you antiplatelet medicine that helps stop platelets from clumping together to form blood clots or anticoagulant medicine (blood thinner) that keeps existing blood clots from getting larger. Two common medicines are aspirin and clopidogrel. Medical Procedures If you have carotid artery disease, your doctor may recommend a carotid endarterectomy or carotid arteryangioplasty. Both procedures open blocked carotid arteries. Researchers are testing other treatments for ischemic stroke, such as intra-arterial thrombolysis and mechanical clot removal in cerebral ischemia (MERCI). In intra-arterial thrombolysis, a long flexible tube called a catheter is put into your groin (upper thigh) and threaded to the tiny arteries of the brain. Your doctor can deliver medicine through this catheter to break up a blood clot in the brain. MERCI is a device that can remove blood clots from an artery. During the procedure, a catheter is threaded through a carotid artery to the affected artery in the brain. The device is then used to pull the blood clot out through the catheter. Treating a Hemorrhagic Stroke A hemorrhagic stroke occurs if an artery in the brain leaks blood or ruptures. The first steps in treating a hemorrhagic stroke are to find the cause of bleeding in the brain and then control it. Unlike ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes arent treated with antiplatelet medicines and blood thinners because these medicines can make bleeding worse. If youre taking antiplatelet medicines or blood thinners and have a hemorrhagic stroke, youll be taken off the medicine. If high blood pressure is the cause of bleeding in the brain, your doctor may prescribe medicines to lower your blood pressure. This can help prevent further bleeding. Surgery also may be needed to treat a hemorrhagic stroke. The types of surgery used include aneurysm clipping, coil embolization, and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) repair. Aneurysm Clipping and Coil Embolization If an aneurysm (a balloon-like bulge in an artery) is the cause of a stroke, your doctor may recommend aneurysm clipping or coil embolization. Aneurysm clipping is done to block off the aneurysm from the blood vessels in the brain. This surgery helps prevent further leaking of blood from the aneurysm. It also can help prevent the aneurysm from bursting again.During the procedure, a surgeon will make an incision (cut) in the brain and place a tiny clamp at the base of the aneurysm. Youll be given medicine to make you sleep during the surgery. After the surgery, youll need to stay in the hospitals intensive care unit for a few days. Coil embolization is a less complex procedure for treating an aneurysm. The surgeon will insert a tube called a catheter into an artery in the groin. He or she will thread the tube to the site of the aneurysm.Then, a tiny coil will be pushed through the tube and into the aneurysm. The coil will cause a blood clot to form, which will block blood flow through the aneurysm and prevent it from burstingagain.Coil embolization is done in a hospital. Youll be given medicine to make you sleep during thesurgery. Arteriovenous Malformation Repair If an AVM is the cause of a stroke, your doctor may recommend an AVM repair. (An AVM is a tangle of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture within the brain.) AVM repair helps prevent further bleeding in the brain. Doctors use several methods to repair AVMs. These methods include: Injecting a substance into the blood vessels of the AVM to block blood flow Surgery to remove the AVM Using radiation to shrink the blood vessels of the AVM Treating Stroke Risk Factors After initial treatment for a stroke or TIA, your doctor will treat your risk factors. He or she may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes to help control your risk factors. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes may include: heart-healthy eating maintaining a healthy weight managing stress physical activity quitting smoking If lifestyle changes arent enough, you may need medicine to control your risk factors. Heart-Healthy Eating Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include: Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots Whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas When following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating: A lot of red meat Palm and coconut oils Sugary foods and beverages Two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise: Saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals Trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats. Saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5percent to 6percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples: 1,200 calories a day 8 grams of saturated fat a day 1,500 calories a day 10 grams of saturated fat a day 1,800 calories a day 12 grams of saturated fat a day 2,000 calories a day 13 grams of saturated fat a day 2,500 calories a day 17 grams of saturated fat a day Not all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are: Avocados Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils Peanut butter Salmon and trout Tofu Sodium Try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt. The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH. Alcohol Try to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is: 12 ounces of beer 5 ounces of wine 1 ounces of liquor Maintaining a Healthy Weight Maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for stroke. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active. Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI: Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight. Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range. Between 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight. Of 30.0 or higher is considered obese. A general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal. Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk. If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol. Managing Stress Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as: A stress management program Meditation Physical activity Relaxation therapy Talking things out with friends or family Physical Activity Regular physical activity can lower many risk factors for stroke. Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week. Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you. Read more about physical activity at: Physical Activity and Your Heart U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans Quitting Smoking If you smoke or use tobacco, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for stroke. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.

				<AnswerText>What are the treatments for Stroke?: Medication or drug therapy is the most common treatment for stroke. The most popular kinds of drugs to prevent or treat stroke are antithrombotics -- which include antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants -- and thrombolytics. Antithrombotics prevent the formation of blood clots that can become stuck in an artery of the brain and cause strokes. - In the case of stroke, doctors prescribe antiplatelet drugs mainly for prevention.

The most commonly used oral anticoagulants include warfarin, also known as Coumadin, dabigatran (Pradaxa) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto). Injectable anticoagulants include heparin, enoxaparin (Lovenox), and dalteparin (Fragmin). Anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke by reducing the clotting property of the blood.

Injectable anticoagulants include heparin, enoxaparin (Lovenox), and dalteparin (Fragmin). Thrombolytic drugs halt the stroke by dissolving the blood clot that is blocking blood flow to the brain. Ischemic strokes -- the most common kind -- can be treated with thrombolytic drugs. But a person needs to be at the hospital as soon as possible after symptoms start to be evaluated and receive treatment. A thrombolytic drug known as t-PA can be effective if a person receives it intravenously (in a vein) within 3 hours after his or her stroke symptoms have started. Because there is such a narrow time window for giving t-PA, it is important to note the time any stroke symptoms appear. Since thrombolytic drugs can increase bleeding, t-PA should be used only after the doctor is certain that the patient has suffered an ischemic and not a hemorrhagic stroke. Neuroprotectants are medications or other treatments that protect the brain from secondary injury caused by stroke. Although the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has not approved any neuroprotectants for use in stroke at this time, many have been tested or are being tested in clinical trials. Cooling of the brain (hypothermia) is beneficial for improving neurological function after a cardiac arrest.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Atrial Fibrillation and Stroke (Treatment): Within a few hours after onset of a stroke, treatment with drugs or devices that dissolve or break up the clot can restore blood flow to the brain and lead to a better recovery. To prevent strokes related to AF, doctors often prescribe medications to prevent formation of clots in the heart, which can travel to the brain and cause stroke. Immediately after a stroke, doctors may temporarily administer heparin by injection, while starting an oral medication for long-term protection from clots. The most commonly used drug has been warfarin. People taking warfarin must be closely monitored to make sure their blood is thin enough to prevent clots, but not so thin as to promote bleeding. Since some foods, vitamin supplements, and medications can affect warfarin action, keeping the blood just thin enough can be tricky. More recently, a number of new blood thinners, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, have been shown to be as effective as warfarin in stroke prevention. These newer medications do not require regular blood test monitoring and may have less tendency to cause bleeding due to making the blood too thin. Some individuals with AF may have a lower risk of stroke and may be treated with aspirin, either alone or with another antiplatelet agency like clopidogrel. Other treatments for AF include medications such as beta blockers or calcium channel blockers to slow the heartbeat, and anti-arrhythmic drugs or electrical cardioversion (which delivers an electrical shock to the heart) to normalize the heartbeat.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What are the treatments for Stroke?: Surgery Surgery can be used to prevent stroke, to treat stroke, or to repair damage to the blood vessels or malformations in and around the brain. - Carotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure in which a surgeon removes fatty deposits, or plaque, from the inside of one of the carotid arteries. The procedure is performed to prevent stroke. The carotid arteries are located in the neck and are the main suppliers of blood to the brain.

The carotid arteries are located in the neck and are the main suppliers of blood to the brain. Vascular Interventions In addition to surgery, a variety of techniques have been developed to allow certain vascular problems to be treated from inside the artery using specialized catheters with the goal of improving blood flow. (Vascular is a word that refers to blood vessels, arteries, and veins that carry blood throughout the body.) A catheter is a very thin, flexible tube that can be inserted into one of the major arteries of the leg or arm and then directed through the blood vessels to the diseased artery. Physicians trained in this technique called angiography undergo additional training to treat problems in the arteries of the brain or spinal cord. These physicians are called neurointerventionalists. - Angioplasty is widely used by angiographers to open blocked heart arteries, and is also used to prevent stroke. Angioplasty is a procedure in which a special catheter is inserted into the narrowed artery and then a balloon at the tip of the catheter is inflated to open the blocked artery.

In this procedure an angiographer inserts a catheter into the artery in the groin and then positions the tip of the catheter inside the narrowed artery. A stent is a tube-like device made of a mesh-like material that can be slipped into position over the catheter. When positioned inside the narrowed segment the stent is expanded to widen the artery and the catheter is removed. Angioplasty or stenting of the carotid artery can cause pieces of the diseased plaque to loosen. An umbrella-like device is often temporarily expanded above to prevent these pieces from traveling to the brain. Stenting is another procedure used to prevent stroke.

				<AnswerText>Ischemic Stroke (Summary): Summary A stroke is a medical emergency. There are two types - ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke is the most common type. It is usually caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This keeps blood from flowing to the brain. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. Another cause is stenosis, or narrowing of the artery. This can happen because of atherosclerosis, a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) occur when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted briefly. Having a TIA can mean you are at risk for having a more serious stroke. Symptoms of stroke are - Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body) - Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech - Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes - Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination - Sudden severe headache with no known cause It is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. Blood thinners may be used to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot. Post-stroke rehabilitation can help people overcome disabilities caused by stroke damage.

				<AnswerText>Stroke (What Is...): A stroke occurs if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a portion of the brain is blocked. Without oxygen, brain cells start to die after a few minutes. Sudden bleeding in the brain also can cause a stroke if it damages brain cells. If brain cells die or are damaged because of a stroke, symptoms occur in the parts of the body that these brain cells control. Examples of stroke symptoms include sudden weakness; paralysis or numbness of the face, arms, or legs (paralysis is an inability to move); trouble speaking or understanding speech; and trouble seeing. A stroke is a serious medical condition that requires emergency care. A stroke can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death. If you think you or someone else is having a stroke, call 9–1–1 right away. Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. During a stroke, every minute counts. Overview The two main types of stroke are ischemic (is-KE-mik) and hemorrhagic (hem-ah-RAJ-ik). Ischemic is the more common type of stroke. An ischemic stroke occurs if an artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked. Blood clots often cause the blockages that lead to ischemic strokes. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs if an artery in the brain leaks blood or ruptures (breaks open). The pressure from the leaked blood damages brain cells. High blood pressure and aneurysms (AN-u-risms) are examples of conditions that can cause hemorrhagic strokes. (Aneurysms are balloon-like bulges in an artery that can stretch and burst.) Another condition that’s similar to a stroke is a transient ischemic attack, also called a TIA or “mini-stroke.” A TIA occurs if blood flow to a portion of the brain is blocked only for a short time. Thus, damage to the brain cells isn’t permanent (lasting). Like ischemic strokes, TIAs often are caused by blood clots. Although TIAs are not full-blown strokes, they greatly increase the risk of having a stroke. If you have a TIA, it’s important for your doctor to find the cause so you can take steps to prevent a stroke. Both strokes and TIAs require emergency care. Outlook Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States. Many factors can raise your risk of having a stroke. Talk with your doctor about how you can control these risk factors and help prevent a stroke. If you have a stroke, prompt treatment can reduce damage to your brain and help you avoid lasting disabilities. Prompt treatment also may help prevent another stroke. Researchers continue to study the causes and risk factors for stroke. They’re also finding new and better treatments and new ways to help the brain repair itself after a stroke.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Stroke (Diagnosis): Your doctor will diagnose a stroke based on your signs and symptoms, your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. Your doctor will want to find out the type of stroke you’ve had, its cause, the part of the brain that&apos;s affected, and whether you have bleeding in the brain. If your doctor thinks you’ve had a transient ischemic attack (TIA), he or she will look for its cause to help prevent a future stroke. Medical History and Physical Exam Your doctor will ask you or a family member about your risk factors for stroke. Examples of risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, heart disease, and a personal or family history of stroke. Your doctor also will ask about your signs and symptoms and when they began. During the physical exam, your doctor will check your mental alertness and your coordination and balance. He or she will check for numbness or weakness in your face, arms, and legs; confusion; and trouble speaking and seeing clearly. Your doctor will look for signs of carotid artery disease, a common cause of ischemic stroke. He or she will listen to your carotid arteries with a stethoscope. A whooshing sound called a bruit (broo-E) may suggest changed or reduced blood flow due to plaque buildup in the carotid arteries. Diagnostic Tests and Procedures Your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests to diagnose a stroke or TIA. Brain Computed Tomography A brain computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) scan, or brain CT scan, is a painless test that uses x rays to take clear, detailed pictures of your brain. This test often is done right after a stroke is suspected. A brain CT scan can show bleeding in the brain or damage to the brain cells from a stroke. The test also can show other brain conditions that may be causing your symptoms. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the organs and structures in your body. This test can detect changes in brain tissue and damage to brain cells from a stroke. An MRI may be used instead of, or in addition to, a CT scan to diagnose a stroke. Computed Tomography Arteriogram and Magnetic Resonance Arteriogram A CT arteriogram (CTA) and magnetic resonance arteriogram (MRA) can show the large blood vessels in the brain. These tests may give your doctor more information about the site of a blood clot and the flow of blood through your brain. Carotid Ultrasound Carotid ultrasound is a painless and harmless test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the insides of your carotid arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your brain. Carotid ultrasound shows whether plaque has narrowed or blocked your carotid arteries. Your carotid ultrasound test may include a Doppler ultrasound. Doppler ultrasound is a special test that shows the speed and direction of blood moving through your blood vessels. Carotid Angiography Carotid angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show the insides of your carotid arteries. For this test, a small tube called a catheter is put into an artery, usually in the groin (upper thigh). The tube is then moved up into one of your carotid arteries. Your doctor will inject a substance (called contrast dye) into the carotid artery. The dye helps make the artery visible on x-ray pictures. Heart Tests EKG (Electrocardiogram) An EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart&apos;s electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart. An EKG can help detect heart problems that may have led to a stroke. For example, the test can help diagnose atrial fibrillation or a previous heart attack. Echocardiography Echocardiography (EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee), or echo, is a painless test that uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart. The test gives information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart&apos;s chambers and valves are working. Echo can detect possible blood clots inside the heart and problems with the aorta. The aorta is the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from your heart to all parts of your body. Blood Tests Your doctor also may use blood tests to help diagnose a stroke. A blood glucose test measures the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood. Low blood glucose levels may cause symptoms similar to those of a stroke. A platelet count measures the number of platelets in your blood. Blood platelets are cell fragments that help your blood clot. Abnormal platelet levels may be a sign of a bleeding disorder (not enough clotting) or a thrombotic disorder (too much clotting). Your doctor also may recommend blood tests to measure how long it takes for your blood to clot. Two tests that may be used are called PT and PTT tests. These tests show whether your blood is clotting normally.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Stroke (Diagnosis): To determine the most appropriate treatment for your stroke, your emergency team needs to evaluate the type of stroke you&apos;re having and the areas of your brain affected by the stroke. They also need to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, such as a brain tumor or a drug reaction. Your doctor may use several tests to determine your risk of stroke, including: - Physical examination. Your doctor will ask you or a family member what symptoms you&apos;ve been having, when they started and what you were doing when they began. Your doctor then will evaluate whether these symptoms are still present. Your doctor will want to know what medications you take and whether you have experienced any head injuries. You&apos;ll be asked about your personal and family history of heart disease, transient ischemic attack and stroke. Your doctor will check your blood pressure and use a stethoscope to listen to your heart and to listen for a whooshing sound (bruit) over your neck (carotid) arteries, which may indicate atherosclerosis. Your doctor may also use an ophthalmoscope to check for signs of tiny cholesterol crystals or clots in the blood vessels at the back of your eyes. - Blood tests. You may have several blood tests, which tell your care team how fast your blood clots, whether your blood sugar is abnormally high or low, whether critical blood chemicals are out of balance, or whether you may have an infection. Managing your blood&apos;s clotting time and levels of sugar and other key chemicals will be part of your stroke care. - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses a series of X-rays to create a detailed image of your brain. A CT scan can show a hemorrhage, tumor, stroke and other conditions. Doctors may inject a dye into your bloodstream to view your blood vessels in your neck and brain in greater detail (computerized tomography angiography). There are different types of CT scans that your doctor may use depending on your situation. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses powerful radio waves and magnets to create a detailed view of your brain. An MRI can detect brain tissue damaged by an ischemic stroke and brain hemorrhages. Your doctor may inject a dye into a blood vessel to view the arteries and veins and highlight blood flow (magnetic resonance angiography, or magnetic resonance venography). - Carotid ultrasound. In this test, sound waves create detailed images of the inside of the carotid arteries in your neck. This test shows buildup of fatty deposits (plaques) and blood flow in your carotid arteries. - Cerebral angiogram. In this test, your doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube (catheter) through a small incision, usually in your groin, and guides it through your major arteries and into your carotid or vertebral artery. Then your doctor injects a dye into your blood vessels to make them visible under X-ray imaging. This procedure gives a detailed view of arteries in your brain and neck. - Echocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to create detailed images of your heart. An echocardiogram can find a source of clots in your heart that may have traveled from your heart to your brain and caused your stroke. You may have a transesophageal echocardiogram. In this test, your doctor inserts a flexible tube with a small device (transducer) attached into your throat and down into the tube that connects the back of your mouth to your stomach (esophagus).

				<AnswerText>How to diagnose Stroke?: Doctors have several techniques and imaging tools to help diagnose stroke quickly and accurately. The first step in diagnosis is a short neurological examination, or an evaluation of the nervous system. When a possible stroke patient arrives at a hospital, a health care professional, usually a doctor or nurse, will ask the patient or a companion what happened and when the symptoms began. Blood tests, an electrocardiogram, and a brain scan such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will often be done.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Stroke (Diagnosing and Treating Stroke): A doctor will diagnose a stroke based on symptoms, medical history, and medical tests such as a CT scan. A CT scan is a test that lets doctors look closely at pictures of the brain.All strokes benefit from immediate medical treatment! But only people with ischemic stroke, the kind caused by a blood clot, can be helped by a drug called t-PA (tissue-plasminogen activator). This drug breaks up blood clots and can greatly lessen the damage caused by an ischemic stroke. Starting treatment with t-PA within 3 hours after an ischemic stroke is important to recovery. To be evaluated and receive treatment, patients need to get to the hospital within 60 minutes. Getting to a hospital right away allows time for a CT scan of the brain. This scan will show whether the clot-busting medicine is the right treatment choice.With stroke, treatment depends on the stage of the disease. There are three treatment stages for stroke: prevention, therapy immediately after stroke, and rehabilitation after stroke. Stroke therapies include medications, surgery, and rehabilitation.Medication or drug therapy is the most common treatment for stroke. The most popular kinds of drugs to prevent or treat stroke are antithrombotics--which include antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants--and thrombolytics. Thrombolytic drugs, like t-PA, halt the stroke by dissolving the blood clot that is blocking blood flow to the brain. Antithrombotics prevent the formation of blood clots that can become stuck in an artery of the brain and cause strokes.Surgery and vascular procedures can be used to prevent stroke, treat stroke, or repair damage to the blood vessels or malformations in and around the brain. These include angioplasty, stenting, and carotid endarterectomy.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ischemic Stroke (Summary): Summary A stroke is a medical emergency. There are two types - ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke is the most common type. It is usually caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This keeps blood from flowing to the brain. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. Another cause is stenosis, or narrowing of the artery. This can happen because of atherosclerosis, a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) occur when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted briefly. Having a TIA can mean you are at risk for having a more serious stroke. Symptoms of stroke are - Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body) - Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech - Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes - Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination - Sudden severe headache with no known cause It is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. Blood thinners may be used to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot. Post-stroke rehabilitation can help people overcome disabilities caused by stroke damage.

				<AnswerText>Stroke: A stroke occurs if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a portion of the brain is blocked. Without oxygen, brain cells start to die after a few minutes. Sudden bleeding in the brain also can cause a stroke if it damages brain cells. If brain cells die or are damaged because of a stroke, symptoms occur in the parts of the body that these brain cells control. Examples of stroke symptoms include sudden weakness; paralysis or numbness of the face, arms, or legs (paralysis is an inability to move); trouble speaking or understanding speech; and trouble seeing. A stroke is a serious medical condition that requires emergency care. A stroke can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death. If you think you or someone else is having a stroke, call 9–1–1 right away. Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. During a stroke, every minute counts. Overview The two main types of stroke are ischemic (is-KE-mik) and hemorrhagic (hem-ah-RAJ-ik). Ischemic is the more common type of stroke. An ischemic stroke occurs if an artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked. Blood clots often cause the blockages that lead to ischemic strokes. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs if an artery in the brain leaks blood or ruptures (breaks open). The pressure from the leaked blood damages brain cells. High blood pressure and aneurysms (AN-u-risms) are examples of conditions that can cause hemorrhagic strokes. (Aneurysms are balloon-like bulges in an artery that can stretch and burst.) Another condition that’s similar to a stroke is a transient ischemic attack, also called a TIA or “mini-stroke.” A TIA occurs if blood flow to a portion of the brain is blocked only for a short time. Thus, damage to the brain cells isn’t permanent (lasting). Like ischemic strokes, TIAs often are caused by blood clots. Although TIAs are not full-blown strokes, they greatly increase the risk of having a stroke. If you have a TIA, it’s important for your doctor to find the cause so you can take steps to prevent a stroke. Both strokes and TIAs require emergency care. Outlook Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States. Many factors can raise your risk of having a stroke. Talk with your doctor about how you can control these risk factors and help prevent a stroke. If you have a stroke, prompt treatment can reduce damage to your brain and help you avoid lasting disabilities. Prompt treatment also may help prevent another stroke. Researchers continue to study the causes and risk factors for stroke. They’re also finding new and better treatments and new ways to help the brain repair itself after a stroke. Ischemic Stroke An ischemic stroke occurs if an artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked. Blood clots often cause the blockages that lead to ischemic strokes. The two types of ischemic stroke are thrombotic (throm-BOT-ik) and embolic (em-BOL-ik). In a thrombotic stroke, a blood clot (thrombus) forms in an artery that supplies blood to the brain. In an embolic stroke, a blood clot or other substance (such as plaque, a fatty material) travels through the bloodstream to an artery in the brain. (A blood clot or piece of plaque that travels through the bloodstream is called an embolus.) With both types of ischemic stroke, the blood clot or plaque blocks the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a portion of the brain. Ischemic Stroke Hemorrhagic Stroke A hemorrhagic stroke occurs if an artery in the brain leaks blood or ruptures (breaks open). The pressure from the leaked blood damages brain cells. The two types of hemorrhagic stroke are intracerebral (in-trah-SER-e-bral) and subarachnoid (sub-ah-RAK-noyd). In an intracerebral hemorrhage, a blood vessel inside the brain leaks blood or ruptures. In a subarachnoid hemorrhage, a blood vessel on the surface of the brain leaks blood or ruptures. When this happens, bleeding occurs between the inner and middle layers of the membranes that cover the brain. In both types of hemorrhagic stroke, the leaked blood causes swelling of the brain and increased pressure in the skull. The swelling and pressure damage cells and tissues in the brain. Hemorrhagic Stroke Brain attack Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) Hemorrhagic stroke (includes intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage) Ischemic stroke (includes thrombotic stroke and embolic stroke) A transient ischemic attack sometimes is called a TIA or mini-stroke. A TIA has the same symptoms as a stroke, and it increases your risk of having a stroke. Ischemic Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack An ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurs if an artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked. Many medical conditions can increase the risk of ischemic stroke or TIA. For example, atherosclerosis (ath-er-o-skler-O-sis) is a disease in which a fatty substance called plaque builds up on the inner walls of the arteries. Plaque hardens and narrows the arteries, which limits the flow of blood to tissues and organs (such as the heart and brain). Plaque in an artery can crack or rupture (break open). Blood platelets (PLATE-lets), which are disc-shaped cell fragments, stick to the site of the plaque injury and clump together to form blood clots. These clots can partly or fully block an artery. Plaque can build up in any artery in the body, including arteries in the heart, brain, and neck. The two main arteries on each side of the neck are called the carotid (ka-ROT-id) arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to the brain, face, scalp, and neck. When plaque builds up in the carotid arteries, the condition is called carotid artery disease. Carotid artery disease causes many of the ischemic strokes and TIAs that occur in the United States. An embolic stroke (a type of ischemic stroke) or TIA also can occur if a blood clot or piece of plaque breaks away from the wall of an artery. The clot or plaque can travel through the bloodstream and get stuck in one of the brain’s arteries. This stops blood flow through the artery and damages brain cells. Heart conditions and blood disorders also can cause blood clots that can lead to a stroke or TIA. For example, atrial fibrillation (A-tre-al fi-bri-LA-shun), or AF, is a common cause of embolic stroke. In AF, the upper chambers of the heart contract in a very fast and irregular way. As a result, some blood pools in the heart. The pooling increases the risk of blood clots forming in the heart chambers. An ischemic stroke or TIA also can occur because of lesions caused by atherosclerosis. These lesions may form in the small arteries of the brain, and they can block blood flow to the brain. Hemorrhagic Stroke Sudden bleeding in the brain can cause a hemorrhagic stroke. The bleeding causes swelling of the brain and increased pressure in the skull. The swelling and pressure damage brain cells and tissues. Examples of conditions that can cause a hemorrhagic stroke include high blood pressure, aneurysms, and arteriovenous (ar-TEER-e-o-VE-nus) malformations (AVMs). &quot;Blood pressure&quot; is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps blood. If blood pressure rises and stays high over time, it can damage the body in many ways. Aneurysms are balloon-like bulges in an artery that can stretch and burst. AVMs are tangles of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture within the brain. High blood pressure can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in people who have aneurysms or AVMs. Certain traits, conditions, and habits can raise your risk of having a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). These traits, conditions, and habits are known as risk factors. The more risk factors you have, the more likely you are to have a stroke. You can treat or control some risk factors, such as high blood pressure and smoking. Other risk factors, such as age and gender, you can’t control. The major risk factors for stroke include: High blood pressure. High blood pressure is the main risk factor for stroke. Blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) over time. If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher. Diabetes. Diabetes is a disease in which the blood sugar level is high because the body doesn’t make enough insulin or doesn’t use its insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells where it’s used for energy. Heart diseases. Coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation can cause blood clots that can lead to a stroke. Smoking. Smoking can damage blood vessels and raise blood pressure. Smoking also may reduce the amount of oxygen that reaches your body’s tissues. Exposure to secondhand smoke also can damage the blood vessels. Age and gender. Your risk of stroke increases as you get older. At younger ages, men are more likely than women to have strokes. However, women are more likely to die from strokes. Women who take birth control pills also are at slightly higher risk of stroke. Race and ethnicity. Strokes occur more often in African American, Alaska Native, and American Indian adults than in white, Hispanic, or Asian American adults. Personal or family history of stroke or TIA. If you’ve had a stroke, you’re at higher risk for another one. Your risk of having a repeat stroke is the highest right after a stroke. A TIA also increases your risk of having a stroke, as does having a family history of stroke. Brain aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Aneurysms are balloon-like bulges in an artery that can stretch and burst. AVMs are tangles of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture (break open) within the brain. AVMs may be present at birth, but often aren’t diagnosed until they rupture. Other risk factors for stroke, many of which of you can control, include: Alcohol and illegal drug use, including cocaine, amphetamines, and other drugs Certain medical conditions, such as sickle cell disease, vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels), and bleeding disorders Lack of physical activity Overweight and Obesity Stress and depression Unhealthy cholesterol levels Unhealthy diet Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but not aspirin, may increase the risk of heart attack or stroke, particularly in patients who have had a heart attack or cardiac bypass surgery. The risk may increase the longer NSAIDs are used. Common NSAIDs include ibuprofen and naproxen. Following a heart-healthy lifestyle can lower the risk of stroke. Some people also may need to take medicines to lower their risk. Sometimes strokes can occur in people who don’t have any known risk factors. The signs and symptoms of a stroke often develop quickly. However, they can develop over hours or even days. The type of symptoms depends on the type of stroke and the area of the brain that’s affected. How long symptoms last and how severe they are vary among different people. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include: Sudden weakness Paralysis (an inability to move) or numbness of the face, arms, or legs, especially on one side of the body Confusion Trouble speaking or understanding speech Trouble seeing in one or both eyes Problems breathing Dizziness, trouble walking, loss of balance or coordination, and unexplained falls Loss of consciousness Sudden and severe headache A transient ischemic attack (TIA) has the same signs and symptoms as a stroke. However, TIA symptoms usually last less than 1–2 hours (although they may last up to 24 hours). A TIA may occur only once in a person’s lifetime or more often. At first, it may not be possible to tell whether someone is having a TIA or stroke. All stroke-like symptoms require medical care. If you think you or someone else is having a TIA or stroke, call 9–1–1 right away. Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. During a stroke, every minute counts. Stroke Complications After you’ve had a stroke, you may develop other complications, such as: Blood clots and muscle weakness. Being immobile (unable to move around) for a long time can raise your risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs. Being immobile also can lead to muscle weakness and decreased muscle flexibility. Problems swallowing and pneumonia. If a stroke affects the muscles used for swallowing, you may have a hard time eating or drinking. You also may be at risk of inhaling food or drink into your lungs. If this happens, you may develop pneumonia. Loss of bladder control. Some strokes affect the muscles used to urinate. You may need a urinary catheter (a tube placed into the bladder) until you can urinate on your own. Use of these catheters can lead to urinary tract infections. Loss of bowel control or constipation also may occur after a stroke. Your doctor will diagnose a stroke based on your signs and symptoms, your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. Your doctor will want to find out the type of stroke you’ve had, its cause, the part of the brain that&apos;s affected, and whether you have bleeding in the brain. If your doctor thinks you’ve had a transient ischemic attack (TIA), he or she will look for its cause to help prevent a future stroke. Medical History and Physical Exam Your doctor will ask you or a family member about your risk factors for stroke. Examples of risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, heart disease, and a personal or family history of stroke. Your doctor also will ask about your signs and symptoms and when they began. During the physical exam, your doctor will check your mental alertness and your coordination and balance. He or she will check for numbness or weakness in your face, arms, and legs; confusion; and trouble speaking and seeing clearly. Your doctor will look for signs of carotid artery disease, a common cause of ischemic stroke. He or she will listen to your carotid arteries with a stethoscope. A whooshing sound called a bruit (broo-E) may suggest changed or reduced blood flow due to plaque buildup in the carotid arteries. Diagnostic Tests and Procedures Your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests to diagnose a stroke or TIA. Brain Computed Tomography A brain computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) scan, or brain CT scan, is a painless test that uses x rays to take clear, detailed pictures of your brain. This test often is done right after a stroke is suspected. A brain CT scan can show bleeding in the brain or damage to the brain cells from a stroke. The test also can show other brain conditions that may be causing your symptoms. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the organs and structures in your body. This test can detect changes in brain tissue and damage to brain cells from a stroke. An MRI may be used instead of, or in addition to, a CT scan to diagnose a stroke. Computed Tomography Arteriogram and Magnetic Resonance Arteriogram A CT arteriogram (CTA) and magnetic resonance arteriogram (MRA) can show the large blood vessels in the brain. These tests may give your doctor more information about the site of a blood clot and the flow of blood through your brain. Carotid Ultrasound Carotid ultrasound is a painless and harmless test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the insides of your carotid arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your brain. Carotid ultrasound shows whether plaque has narrowed or blocked your carotid arteries. Your carotid ultrasound test may include a Doppler ultrasound. Doppler ultrasound is a special test that shows the speed and direction of blood moving through your blood vessels. Carotid Angiography Carotid angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show the insides of your carotid arteries. For this test, a small tube called a catheter is put into an artery, usually in the groin (upper thigh). The tube is then moved up into one of your carotid arteries. Your doctor will inject a substance (called contrast dye) into the carotid artery. The dye helps make the artery visible on x-ray pictures. Heart Tests EKG (Electrocardiogram) An EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart&apos;s electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart. An EKG can help detect heart problems that may have led to a stroke. For example, the test can help diagnose atrial fibrillation or a previous heart attack. Echocardiography Echocardiography (EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee), or echo, is a painless test that uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart. The test gives information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart&apos;s chambers and valves are working. Echo can detect possible blood clots inside the heart and problems with the aorta. The aorta is the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from your heart to all parts of your body. Blood Tests Your doctor also may use blood tests to help diagnose a stroke. A blood glucose test measures the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood. Low blood glucose levels may cause symptoms similar to those of a stroke. A platelet count measures the number of platelets in your blood. Blood platelets are cell fragments that help your blood clot. Abnormal platelet levels may be a sign of a bleeding disorder (not enough clotting) or a thrombotic disorder (too much clotting). Your doctor also may recommend blood tests to measure how long it takes for your blood to clot. Two tests that may be used are called PT and PTT tests. These tests show whether your blood is clotting normally. Treatment for a stroke depends on whether it is ischemic or hemorrhagic. Treatment for a transient ischemic attack (TIA) depends on its cause, how much time has passed since symptoms began, and whether you have other medical conditions. Strokes and TIAs are medical emergencies. If you have stroke symptoms, call 9–1–1 right away. Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin lifesaving treatment on the way to the emergency room. During a stroke, every minute counts. Once you receive immediate treatment, your doctor will try to treat your stroke risk factors and prevent complications by recommending heart-healthy lifestyle changes. Treating an Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack An ischemic stroke or TIA occurs if an artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked. Often, blood clots cause the blockages that lead to ischemic strokes and TIAs. Treatment for an ischemic stroke or TIA may include medicines and medical procedures. Medicines If you have a stroke caused by a blood clot, you may be given a clot-dissolving, or clot-busting, medication called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). A doctor will inject tPA into a vein in your arm. This type of medication must be given within 4 hours of symptom onset. Ideally, it should be given as soon as possible. The sooner treatment begins, the better your chances of recovery. Thus, it’s important to know the signs and symptoms of a stroke and to call 9–1–1 right away for emergency care. If you can’t have tPA for medical reasons, your doctor may give you antiplatelet medicine that helps stop platelets from clumping together to form blood clots or anticoagulant medicine (blood thinner) that keeps existing blood clots from getting larger. Two common medicines are aspirin and clopidogrel. Medical Procedures If you have carotid artery disease, your doctor may recommend a carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery angioplasty. Both procedures open blocked carotid arteries. Researchers are testing other treatments for ischemic stroke, such as intra-arterial thrombolysis and mechanical clot removal in cerebral ischemia (MERCI). In intra-arterial thrombolysis, a long flexible tube called a catheter is put into your groin (upper thigh) and threaded to the tiny arteries of the brain. Your doctor can deliver medicine through this catheter to break up a blood clot in the brain. MERCI is a device that can remove blood clots from an artery. During the procedure, a catheter is threaded through a carotid artery to the affected artery in the brain. The device is then used to pull the blood clot out through the catheter. Treating a Hemorrhagic Stroke A hemorrhagic stroke occurs if an artery in the brain leaks blood or ruptures. The first steps in treating a hemorrhagic stroke are to find the cause of bleeding in the brain and then control it. Unlike ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes aren’t treated with antiplatelet medicines and blood thinners because these medicines can make bleeding worse. If you’re taking antiplatelet medicines or blood thinners and have a hemorrhagic stroke, you’ll be taken off the medicine. If high blood pressure is the cause of bleeding in the brain, your doctor may prescribe medicines to lower your blood pressure. This can help prevent further bleeding. Surgery also may be needed to treat a hemorrhagic stroke. The types of surgery used include aneurysm clipping, coil embolization, and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) repair. Aneurysm Clipping and Coil Embolization If an aneurysm (a balloon-like bulge in an artery) is the cause of a stroke, your doctor may recommend aneurysm clipping or coil embolization. Aneurysm clipping is done to block off the aneurysm from the blood vessels in the brain. This surgery helps prevent further leaking of blood from the aneurysm. It also can help prevent the aneurysm from bursting again. During the procedure, a surgeon will make an incision (cut) in the brain and place a tiny clamp at the base of the aneurysm. You’ll be given medicine to make you sleep during the surgery. After the surgery, you’ll need to stay in the hospital’s intensive care unit for a few days. Coil embolization is a less complex procedure for treating an aneurysm. The surgeon will insert a tube called a catheter into an artery in the groin. He or she will thread the tube to the site of the aneurysm. Then, a tiny coil will be pushed through the tube and into the aneurysm. The coil will cause a blood clot to form, which will block blood flow through the aneurysm and prevent it from bursting again. Coil embolization is done in a hospital. You’ll be given medicine to make you sleep during the surgery. Arteriovenous Malformation Repair If an AVM is the cause of a stroke, your doctor may recommend an AVM repair. (An AVM is a tangle of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture within the brain.) AVM repair helps prevent further bleeding in the brain. Doctors use several methods to repair AVMs. These methods include: Injecting a substance into the blood vessels of the AVM to block blood flow Surgery to remove the AVM Using radiation to shrink the blood vessels of the AVM Treating Stroke Risk Factors After initial treatment for a stroke or TIA, your doctor will treat your risk factors. He or she may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes to help control your risk factors. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes may include: Heart-healthy eating Aiming for a healthy weight Managing stress Physical activity Quitting smoking If heart-healthy lifestyle changes aren’t enough, you may need medicine to control your risk factors.   Taking action to control your risk factors can help prevent or delay a stroke. If you’ve already had a stroke. Talk to your doctor about whether you may benefit from aspirin primary prevention, or using aspirin to help prevent your first stroke. The following heart-healthy lifestyle changes can help prevent your first stroke and help prevent you from having another one. Be physically active. Physical activity can improve your fitness level and health. Talk with your doctor about what types and amounts of activity are safe for you. Don’t smoke, or if you smoke or use tobacco, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk of stroke. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, secondhand smoke can damage the blood vessels. Aim for a healthy weight. If you’re overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight loss plan. Controlling your weight helps you control risk factors for stroke. Make heart-healthy eating choices. Heart-healthy eating can help lower your risk or prevent a stroke. Manage stress. Use techniques to lower your stress levels. If you or someone in your family has had a stroke, be sure to tell your doctor. By knowing your family history of stroke, you may be able to lower your risk factors and prevent or delay a stroke. If you’ve had a transient ischemic attack (TIA), don’t ignore it. TIAs are warnings, and it’s important for your doctor to find the cause of the TIA so you can take steps to prevent a stroke.   The time it takes to recover from a stroke varies—it can take weeks, months, or even years. Some people recover fully, while others have long-term or lifelong disabilities. Ongoing care, rehabilitation, and emotional support can help you recover and may even help prevent another stroke. If you’ve had a stroke, you’re at risk of having another one. Know the warning signs and what to do if a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurs. Call 9–1–1 as soon as symptoms start. Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. By calling an ambulance, medical personnel can begin lifesaving treatment on the way to the emergency room. During a stroke, every minute counts. Ongoing Care Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes Heart-healthy lifestyle changes can help you recover from a stroke and may help prevent another one. Examples of these changes include heart-healthy eating, aiming for a healthy weight, managing stress, physical activity, and quitting smoking. Medicines Your doctor also may prescribe medicines to help you recover from a stroke or control your stroke risk factors. Take all of your medicines as your doctor prescribes. Don’t cut back on the dosage unless your doctor tells you to do so. If you have side effects or other problems related to your medicines, talk with your doctor. Medicines called anticoagulants or blood thinners, which prevent blood clots or keep existing blood clots from getting larger, are the main treatment for people who have known carotid artery disease, which can lead to a stroke. Two common medicines are aspirin and clopidogrel. You’ll likely need routine blood tests to check how well these medicines are working. The most common side effect of blood thinners is bleeding. This happens if the medicine thins your blood too much. This side effect can be life-threatening. Bleeding can occur inside your body cavities (internal bleeding) or from the surface of your skin (external bleeding). Know the warning signs of bleeding so you can get help right away. They include: Blood in your urine, bright red blood in your stools, or black tarry stools Bright red vomit or vomit that looks like coffee grounds Increased menstrual flow Pain in your abdomen or severe pain in your head Unexplained bleeding from the gums and nose Unexplained bruising or tiny red or purple dots on the skin A lot of bleeding after a fall or injury or easy bruising or bleeding also may mean that your blood is too thin. Call your doctor right away if you have any of these signs. If you have severe bleeding, call 9–1–1. Your doctor also may discuss beginning statin treatment. Doctors recommend statin medications for many people because they help lower or control blood cholesterol levels and decrease the chance for heart attack and stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have: Diabetes Heart disease or have had a stroke High LDL cholesterol levels You should still follow a heart-healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to control your risk factors for stroke. Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Don’t change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. Talk with your doctor about how often you should schedule follow-up visits or tests. These visits and tests can help your doctor monitor your stroke risk factors and adjust your treatment as needed. Rehabilitation After a stroke, you may need rehabilitation (rehab) to help you recover. Rehab may include working with speech, physical, and occupational therapists. Language, Speech, and Memory You may have trouble communicating after a stroke. You may not be able to find the right words, put complete sentences together, or put words together in a way that makes sense. You also may have problems with your memory and thinking clearly. These problems can be very frustrating. Speech and language therapists can help you learn ways to communicate again and improve your memory. Muscle and Nerve Problems A stroke may affect only one side of the body or part of one side. It can cause paralysis (an inability to move) or muscle weakness, which can put you at risk for falling. Physical and occupational therapists can help you strengthen and stretch your muscles. They also can help you relearn how to do daily activities, such as dressing, eating, and bathing. Bladder and Bowel Problems A stroke can affect the muscles and nerves that control the bladder and bowels. You may feel like you have to urinate often, even if your bladder isn’t full. You may not be able to get to the bathroom in time. Medicines and a bladder or bowel specialist can help with these problems. Swallowing and Eating Problems You may have trouble swallowing after a stroke. Signs of this problem are coughing or choking during eating or coughing up food after eating. A speech therapist can help you with these issues. He or she may suggest changes to your diet, such as eating puréed (finely chopped) foods or drinking thick liquids. Mental Health Care and Support After a stroke, you may have changes in your behavior or judgment. For example, your mood may change quickly. Because of these and other changes, you may feel scared, anxious, and depressed. Recovering from a stroke can be slow and frustrating. Talk about how you feel with your health care team. Talking to a professional counselor also can help. If you’re very depressed, your doctor may recommend medicines or other treatments that can improve your quality of life. Joining a patient support group may help you adjust to life after a stroke. You can see how other people have coped with having strokes. Talk with your doctor about local support groups, or check with an area medical center. Support from family and friends also can help relieve fear and anxiety. Let your loved ones know how you feel and what they can do to help you.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Stroke: A stroke is serious, just like a heart attack, so it&apos;s important to know the signs of stroke and act quickly if you suspect someone is having one. Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, and causes more serious long-term disabilities than any other disease. Older people are at higher risk. You can take steps to lower your chance of having a stroke.Know the Signs of Stroke Knowing the symptoms of a stroke and acting quickly could mean the difference between life and disability or death. Call 911 RIGHT AWAY if you see or have any of these symptoms: - Sudden numbness or weakness in the face, arm, or leg-especially on one side of the body - Sudden confusion or trouble speaking or understanding - Sudden problems seeing in one eye or both eyes - Sudden dizziness, loss of balance or coordination, or trouble walking - Sudden severe headache with no known cause Other danger signs that may occur include double vision, drowsiness, and nausea or vomiting. Stroke strikes fast. You should too. Call 911. Never ignore the symptoms of stroke. Call 911 if you have any stroke symptoms, even if they don&apos;t last long. DON&apos;T IGNORE THE SIGNS OF STROKE!

Stroke strikes fast. You should too. Call 911. Never ignore the symptoms of stroke. Call 911 if you have any stroke symptoms, even if they don&apos;t last long. DON&apos;T IGNORE THE SIGNS OF STROKE! A stroke happens when something changes how blood flows through the brain. Blood brings oxygen and nutrients to brain cells. If blood can&apos;t flow to a part of the brain, cells that do not receive enough oxygen suffer and eventually die. If brain cells are without oxygen for only a short time, they can sometimes get better. But brain cells that have died can&apos;t be brought back to life. So, someone who has had a stroke may have trouble speaking, thinking, or walking.There are two major types of stroke. The most common kind, ischemic, is caused by a blood clot or the narrowing of a blood vessel (an artery) leading to the brain. This keeps blood from flowing into other parts of the brain and keeps needed oxygen and nutrients from reaching brain cells. Blockages that cause ischemic strokes stem from three conditions:- Formation of a clot within a blood vessel of the brain or neck, called thrombosis - Movement of a clot from another part of the body, such as from the heart to the neck or brain, called an embolism - Severe narrowing of an artery (stenosis) in or leading to the brain, due to fatty deposits lining the blood vessel wallsIn the second major kind of stroke, hemorrhagic, a broken blood vessel causes bleeding in the brain. This break in the vessel also stops oxygen and nutrients from reaching brain cells.Sometimes the symptoms of a stroke last only a few minutes and then go away. That could be a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a mini-stroke. A TIA is a medical emergency. You should get medical help right away. If a TIA is not treated quickly, it could be followed within hours or days by a major disabling stroke. Some risk factors for stroke, like age, race, and family history, can&apos;t be controlled. But you can make changes to lower your risk of stroke. Talk to your doctor about what you can do. Even if you&apos;re in perfect health, follow these suggestions:- Control your blood pressure. Have your blood pressure checked often. If it is high, follow your doctor&apos;s advice to lower it. Treating high blood pressure lowers the risk of both stroke and heart disease. - Stop smoking. Smoking increases your risk for stroke. It&apos;s never too late to quit. - Control your cholesterol. If you have high cholesterol, work with your doctor to lower it. Cholesterol, a type of fat in the blood, can build up on the walls of your arteries. In time, this can block blood flow and lead to a stroke. - Control your diabetes. Untreated diabetes can damage blood vessels and also leads to narrowed arteries and stroke. Follow your doctor&apos;s suggestions for keeping diabetes under control. - Eat healthy foods. Eat foods that are low in cholesterol and saturated fats. Include a variety of fruits and vegetables every day. - Exercise regularly. Try to make physical activity a part of your everyday life. Do things you like; for example, take a brisk walk, ride a bicycle, or go swimming. Talk with your healthcare provider if you haven&apos;t been exercising and you want to start a vigorous program or increase your physical activity. For more information on exercise and physical activity from the National Institute on Aging at NIH, visit www.nia.nih.gov/Go4Life.If you have had a stroke in the past, it&apos;s important to reduce your risk of a second stroke. Your brain helps you recover from a stroke by drawing on body systems that now do double duty. That means a second stroke can be twice as bad. A doctor will diagnose a stroke based on symptoms, medical history, and medical tests such as a CT scan. A CT scan is a test that lets doctors look closely at pictures of the brain.All strokes benefit from immediate medical treatment! But only people with ischemic stroke, the kind caused by a blood clot, can be helped by a drug called t-PA (tissue-plasminogen activator). This drug breaks up blood clots and can greatly lessen the damage caused by an ischemic stroke. Starting treatment with t-PA within 3 hours after an ischemic stroke is important to recovery. To be evaluated and receive treatment, patients need to get to the hospital within 60 minutes. Getting to a hospital right away allows time for a CT scan of the brain. This scan will show whether the clot-busting medicine is the right treatment choice.With stroke, treatment depends on the stage of the disease. There are three treatment stages for stroke: prevention, therapy immediately after stroke, and rehabilitation after stroke. Stroke therapies include medications, surgery, and rehabilitation.Medication or drug therapy is the most common treatment for stroke. The most popular kinds of drugs to prevent or treat stroke are antithrombotics--which include antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants--and thrombolytics. Thrombolytic drugs, like t-PA, halt the stroke by dissolving the blood clot that is blocking blood flow to the brain. Antithrombotics prevent the formation of blood clots that can become stuck in an artery of the brain and cause strokes.Surgery and vascular procedures can be used to prevent stroke, treat stroke, or repair damage to the blood vessels or malformations in and around the brain. These include angioplasty, stenting, and carotid endarterectomy. A stroke can cause a variety of health problems. How a stroke affects a person depends on which part of the brain is damaged.Someone who has had a stroke might be paralyzed or have weakness, usually on one side of the body. He or she might have trouble speaking or using words. There could be swallowing problems. There might be pain or numbness.Stroke may cause problems with thinking, awareness, attention, learning, judgment, and memory. Someone who has had a stroke might feel depressed or find it hard to control emotions. Post-stroke depression may be more than general sadness resulting from the stroke incident. It is a serious behavioral problem that can hamper recovery and rehabilitation and may even lead to suicide.There are many different ways to help people get better after a stroke. Many treatments start in the hospital and continue at home. Drugs and physical therapy can help improve balance, coordination, and problems such as trouble speaking and using words. Occupational therapy can make it easier to do things like taking a bath or cooking.Some people make a full recovery soon after a stroke. Others take months or even years. But, sometimes the damage is so serious that therapy cannot really help.Learn about rehabilitation after stroke. Stroke is the number one cause of serious adult disability in the United States. Stroke disability is devastating to the stroke patient and family, but therapies are available to help rehabilitate patients after stroke.For most stroke patients, rehabilitation mainly involves physical therapy. The aim of physical therapy is to have the stroke patient relearn simple motor activities such as walking, sitting, standing, lying down, and the process of switching from one type of movement to another.Another type of therapy to help patients relearn daily activities is occupational therapy. This type of therapy also involves exercise and training. Its goal is to help the stroke patient relearn everyday activities such as eating, drinking and swallowing, dressing, bathing, cooking, reading and writing, and using the toilet. Occupational therapists seek to help the patient become independent or semi-independent.Speech therapy helps stroke patients relearn language and speaking skills, or learn other forms of communication. Speech therapy is appropriate for patients who have no problems with cognition or thinking, but have problems understanding speech or written words, or problems forming speech. With time and patience, a stroke survivor should be able to regain some, and sometimes all, language and speaking abilities.Learn more about stroke signs, treatment, and prevention from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

				<AnswerURL>https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10415/familial-breast-cancer</AnswerURL>
				<AnswerText>Familial breast cancer: Familial breast cancer is a cluster of breast cancer within a family. Most cases of breast cancer occur sporadically in people with little to no family history of the condition. Approximately 5-10% of breast cancer is considered &quot;hereditary&quot; and is thought to be caused by an inherited predisposition to breast cancer that is passed down through a family in an autosomal dominant  manner. In some of these families, the underlying genetic cause is not known; however, many of these cases are caused by changes ( mutations ) in the BRCA1 , BRCA2, PTEN, TP53, CDH1, or STK11 genes (which are each associated with a unique hereditary cancer syndrome ).  CHEK2 BRIP1 RAD51 ATM  About 15-20% of women diagnosed with breast cancer have a significant family history of breast cancer (two or more first-degree or second-degree relatives with breast cancer) but have no identifiable mutation in a gene known to cause a hereditary predisposition to breast cancer. These clusters of breast cancer are likely due to a combination of gene(s) and other shared factors such as environment and lifestyle. [1] [2] [3] High-risk cancer screening and other preventative measures such as chemoprevention and/or prophylactic surgeries are typically recommended in women who have an increased risk for breast cancer based on their personal and/or family histories. [4] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance - Breast carcinoma - Heterogeneous - Most cases of breast cancer occur sporadically in people with little to no family history of the condition. They are due to random changes ( mutations ) that occur only in the cells of the breast. These mutations (called somatic mutations ) accumulate during a person&apos;s lifetime and are not inherited or passed on to future generations. [1] Approximately 15-20% of women diagnosed with breast cancer have a significant family history of breast cancer (two or more first-degree or second-degree relatives with breast cancer) but have no identifiable mutation in a gene known to cause a hereditary predisposition to breast cancer. These clusters of breast cancer are likely due to a combination of gene(s) and other shared factors such as environment and lifestyle. [3] An additional 5-10% of breast cancer is considered &quot;hereditary.&quot; These cases are thought to be caused by an inherited predisposition to breast cancer that is passed down through a family in an autosomal dominant  manner. In some of these families, the underlying genetic cause is not known. However, many of these cases are part of a hereditary cancer syndrome . The following cancer syndromes are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and several other types of cancer: [1] [2] [3] Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome due to mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene is the most common known cause of hereditary breast cancer Cowden syndrome is caused by mutations in PTEN gene Li Fraumeni syndrome is caused by mutations in the TP53 gene Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer is caused by mutations in the CDH1 gene Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is caused by mutations in the STK11 gene Of note, some research suggests that inherited mutations in several other genes (including CHEK2, BRIP1, ATM, PALB2, RAD51, BARD1, MRE11A, NBN, and RAD50) may also be associated with an increased risk for breast cancer. However, the risk associated with many of these genes is not well understood. Most are termed &quot;moderate- or low-penetrant&quot; genes which means that, on their own, they would be expected to have a relatively small effect on breast cancer risk. However, in combination with other genes and/or environmental factors , these genes may lead to a significant risk of breast cancer. [1] [3] [2] Most cases of breast cancer occur sporadically in people with little to no family history of the condition. However, approximately 5-10% is thought to be  inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In these cases, a person is born with a mutation in a gene known to cause a hereditary predisposition to breast cancer and has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the mutated gene to his or her child. A person only needs a mutation in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell to have an increased risk for breast cancer. In some cases, a person with familial breast cancer inherits the mutation from a parent who has had or has familial breast cancer. Other cases may result from new ( de novo) mutations in the gene. [1] [2] [3]  An additional 15-20% of women who are diagnosed with breast cancer have a significant family history of breast cancer (two or more first-degree or second-degree relatives who have or have had breast cancer) but the cancer follows no clear pattern of inheritance. These cases of breast cancer may be due to inherited gene(s); shared factors such as environment and lifestyle; or a combination of all these factors. [3] Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging. Healthcare professionals typically look at a person’s medical history, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory test results in order to make a diagnosis. The following resources provide information relating to diagnosis and testing for this condition. If you have questions about getting a diagnosis, you should contact a healthcare professional. Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. Management of familial breast cancer is generally focused on high-risk cancer screening to allow for early detection and treatment of cancer. In general, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends high-risk breast cancer screening for women who have: (1) a personal and family history suggestive of a hereditary cancer syndrome that is associated with breast cancer or (2) a greater than 20% risk of developing breast cancer in their lifetime based largely on family history. The recommended screening protocol includes: [4] Breast awareness and breast self-exams Clinical breast exams every 6-12 months beginning at age 30 or individualized based on the earliest breast cancer diagnosis in the family Annual mammogram and breast MRI beginning at age 30 or individualized based on the earliest breast cancer diagnosis in the family Discussion of other risk reduction strategies such as chemoprevention and/or prophylactic surgeries If the familial breast cancer is part of a known hereditary cancer syndrome, management will also include screening for the other associated cancers.

				<AnswerURL>https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast</AnswerURL>
				<AnswerText>Breast Cancer: The breast is made up of glands called lobules that can make milk and thin tubes called ducts that carry the milk from the lobules to the nipple. Breast tissue also contains fat and connective tissue, lymph nodes, and blood vessels. The most common type of breast cancer is ductal carcinoma, which begins in the cells of the ducts. Breast cancer can also begin in the cells of the lobules and in other tissues in the breast. Ductal carcinoma in situ is a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lining of the ducts but they haven&apos;t spread outside the duct. Breast cancer that has spread from where it began in the ducts or lobules to surrounding tissue is called invasive breast cancer. In inflammatory breast cancer, the breast looks red and swollen and feels warm because the cancer cells block the lymph vessels in the skin. In the U.S., breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women after skin cancer. It can occur in both men and women, but it is rare in men. Each year there are about 100 times more new cases of breast cancer in women than in men. - Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast. - A family history of breast cancer and other factors increase the risk of breast cancer. - Breast cancer is sometimes caused by inherited gene mutations (changes). - The use of certain medicines and other factors decrease the risk of breast cancer. - Signs of breast cancer include a lump or change in the breast. - Tests that examine the breasts are used to detect (find) and diagnose breast cancer. - If cancer is found, tests are done to study the cancer cells. - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. - Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast. - A family history of breast cancer and other factors increase the risk of breast cancer. - Breast cancer is sometimes caused by inherited gene mutations (changes). - The use of certain medicines and other factors decrease the risk of breast cancer. - Signs of breast cancer include a lump or change in the breast. - Tests that examine the breasts are used to detect (find) and diagnose breast cancer. - If cancer is found, tests are done to study the cancer cells. - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. - After breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body. - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - The following stages are used for breast cancer: - Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ) - Stage I - Stage II - Stage IIIA - Stage IIIB - Stage IIIC - Stage IV - The treatment of breast cancer depends partly on the stage of the disease. - After breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body. - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - The following stages are used for breast cancer: - Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ) - Stage I - Stage II - Stage IIIA - Stage IIIB - Stage IIIC - Stage IV - The treatment of breast cancer depends partly on the stage of the disease. - There are different types of treatment for patients with breast cancer. - Five types of standard treatment are used: - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Hormone therapy - Targeted therapy - Treatment for breast cancer may cause side effects. - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. - There are different types of treatment for patients with breast cancer. - Five types of standard treatment are used: - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Hormone therapy - Targeted therapy - Treatment for breast cancer may cause side effects. - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. Early, Localized, or Operable Breast Cancer Treatment of early, localized, or operable breast cancer may include the following: Surgery - Breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy. If cancer is found in the lymph nodes, a lymph node dissection may be done. - Modified radical mastectomy. Breast reconstruction surgery may also be done. Postoperative radiation therapy For women who had breast-conserving surgery, radiation therapy is given to the whole breast to lessen the chance the cancer will come back. Radiation therapy may also be given to lymph nodes in the area. For women who had a modified radical mastectomy, radiation therapy may be given to lessen the chance the cancer will come back if any of the following are true: - Cancer was found in 4 or more lymph nodes. - Cancer had spread to tissue around the lymph nodes. - The tumor was large. - There is tumor close to or remaining in the tissue near the edges of where the tumor was removed. Postoperative systemic therapy Systemic therapy is the use of drugs that can enter the bloodstream and reach cancer cells throughout the body.

Initial Surgery Treatment for men diagnosed with breast cancer is usually modified radical mastectomy. Breast-conserving surgery with lumpectomy may be used for some men. Adjuvant Therapy Therapy given after an operation when cancer cells can no longer be seen is called adjuvant therapy. Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, the patient may be given radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and/or targeted therapy after surgery, to try to kill any cancer cells that may be left. - Node-negative: For men whose cancer is node-negative (cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes), adjuvant therapy should be considered on the same basis as for a woman with breast cancer because there is no evidence that response to therapy is different for men and women. - Node-positive: For men whose cancer is node-positive (cancer has spread to the lymph nodes), adjuvant therapy may include the following: - Chemotherapy. - Targeted therapy with a monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab). - Tamoxifen (to block the effect of estrogen). - Other hormone therapy. These treatments appear to increase survival in men as they do in women. The patient&apos;s response to hormone therapy depends on whether there are hormone receptors (proteins) in the tumor. Most breast cancers in men have these receptors. Hormone therapy is usually recommended for male breast cancer patients, but it can have many side effects, including hot flashes and impotence (the inability to have an erection adequate for sexual intercourse). Distant Metastases Treatment options for metastatic breast cancer (cancer that has spread to distant parts of the body) may include the following: Hormone therapy In men who have just been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer that is hormone receptor positive or if the hormone receptor status is not known, treatment may include: - Tamoxifen therapy. - Aromatase inhibitor therapy (anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane) with or without an LHRH agonist. Sometimes cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor therapy (palbociclib) is also given. In men whose tumors are hormone receptor positive or hormone receptor unknown, with spread to the bone or soft tissue only, and who have been treated with tamoxifen, treatment may include: - Aromatase inhibitor therapy with or without LHRH agonist. - Other hormone therapy such as megestrol acetate, estrogen or androgen therapy, or anti-estrogen therapy such as fulvestrant. Targeted therapy In men with metastatic breast cancer that is hormone receptor positive and has not responded to other treatments, options may include targeted therapy such as: - Trastuzumab, lapatinib, pertuzumab, or mTOR inhibitors. - Antibody-drug conjugate therapy with ado-trastuzumab emtansine. - Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor therapy (palbociclib) combined with letrozole. In men with metastatic breast cancer that is HER2/neu positive, treatment may include: - Targeted therapy such as trastuzumab, pertuzumab, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, or lapatinib. Chemotherapy In men with metastatic breast cancer that is hormone receptor negative, has not responded to hormone therapy, has spread to other organs or has caused symptoms, treatment may include: - Chemotherapy with one or more drugs.

				<AnswerText>Breast cancer screening: Breast cancer screenings can help find breast cancer early, before you notice any symptoms. In many cases, finding breast cancer early makes it easier to treat or cure. But screenings also have risks, such as missing signs of cancer. When to start screenings may depend on your age and risk factors. A mammogram is the most common type of screening. It is an x-ray of the breast using a special machine. This test is done in a hospital or clinic and only takes a few minutes. Mammograms can find tumors that are too small to feel. Mammography is performed to screen women to detect early breast cancer when it is more likely to be cured. Mammography is generally recommended for: - Women starting at age 40, repeated every 1 to 2 years. (This is not recommended by all expert organizations.) - All women starting at age 50, repeated every 1 to 2 years. - Women with a mother or sister who had breast cancer at a younger age should consider yearly mammograms. They should begin earlier than the age at which their youngest family member was diagnosed. Mammograms work best at finding breast cancer in women ages 50 to 74. For women younger than age 50, the screening can be helpful, but may miss some cancers. This may be because younger women have denser breast tissue, which makes it harder to spot cancer. It is not clear how well mammograms work at finding cancer in women age 75 and older. This is an exam to feel the breasts and underarms for lumps or unusual changes. Your health care provider may perform a clinical breast exam (CBE). You can also check your breasts on your own. This is called a breast self-exam (BSE). Doing self-exams may help you become more familiar with your breasts. This may make it easier to notice unusual breast changes. Keep in mind that breast exams do not reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer. They also do not work as well as mammograms to find cancer. For this reason, you should not rely only on breast exams to screen for cancer. Not all experts agree about when to have or start having breast exams. In fact, some groups do not recommend them at all. However, this does not mean you should not do or have breast exams. Some women prefer to have exams. Talk with your provider about the benefits and risks for breast exams and if they are right for you. An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to find signs of cancer. This screening is done only in women who have a high risk for breast cancer. Women at high risk for breast cancer (greater than 20% to 25% lifetime risk) should have an MRI along with a mammogram every year. You may have a high risk if you have: - A family history of breast cancer, most often when your mother or sister had breast cancer at an early age - Lifetime risk for breast cancer is 20% to 25% or higher - Certain BRCA mutations, whether you carry this marker or a first degree relative does and you have not been tested - First degree relatives with certain genetic syndromes (Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndromes) It is not clear how well MRIs work to find breast cancer. Although MRIs find more breast cancers than mammograms, they are also more likely to show signs of cancer when there is no cancer. This is called a false-positive result. For women who have had cancer in one breast, MRIs can be very helpful for finding hidden tumors in the other breast. You should do a MRI screening if you: - Are at very high risk for breast cancer (those with a strong family history or genetic markers for breast cancer) - Have very dense breast tissue When and how often to have a breast screening test is a choice you must make. Different expert groups do not fully agree on the best timing for screening. Before having a mammogram, talk to your provider about the pros and cons. Ask about: - Your risk for breast cancer. - Whether screening decreases your chance of dying from breast cancer. - Whether there is any harm from breast cancer screening, such as side effects from testing or overtreatment of cancer when it&apos;s discovered. Risks of screenings can include: - False-positive results. This occurs when a test shows cancer when there is none. This can lead to having more tests that also have risks. It can also cause anxiety. You may be more likely to have a false-positive result if you are younger, have a family history of breast cancer, have had breast biopsies in the past, or take hormones. - False-negative results. These are tests that come back normal even though there is cancer. Women who have false-negative results do not know they have breast cancer and delay treatment. - Exposure to radiation is a risk factor for breast cancer. Mammograms expose your breasts to radiation. - Overtreatment. Mammograms and MRIs may find slow-growing cancers. These are cancers that may not shorten your life. At this time, it is not possible to know which cancers will grow and spread, so when cancer is found it is usually treated. Treatment can cause serious side effects.

				<AnswerText>Familial breast cancer (Summary): Familial breast cancer is a cluster of breast cancer within a family. Most cases of breast cancer occur sporadically in people with little to no family history of the condition. Approximately 5-10% of breast cancer is considered &quot;hereditary&quot; and is thought to be caused by an inherited predisposition to breast cancer that is passed down through a family in an autosomal dominant  manner. In some of these families, the underlying genetic cause is not known; however, many of these cases are caused by changes ( mutations ) in the BRCA1 , BRCA2, PTEN, TP53, CDH1, or STK11 genes (which are each associated with a unique hereditary cancer syndrome ).  CHEK2 BRIP1 RAD51 ATM  About 15-20% of women diagnosed with breast cancer have a significant family history of breast cancer (two or more first-degree or second-degree relatives with breast cancer) but have no identifiable mutation in a gene known to cause a hereditary predisposition to breast cancer. These clusters of breast cancer are likely due to a combination of gene(s) and other shared factors such as environment and lifestyle. [1] [2] [3] High-risk cancer screening and other preventative measures such as chemoprevention and/or prophylactic surgeries are typically recommended in women who have an increased risk for breast cancer based on their personal and/or family histories.

				<AnswerText>Breast cancer screening (Benefits and Risks of Screenings): When and how often to have a breast screening test is a choice you must make. Different expert groups do not fully agree on the best timing for screening. Before having a mammogram, talk to your provider about the pros and cons. Ask about: - Your risk for breast cancer. - Whether screening decreases your chance of dying from breast cancer. - Whether there is any harm from breast cancer screening, such as side effects from testing or overtreatment of cancer when it&apos;s discovered. Risks of screenings can include: - False-positive results. This occurs when a test shows cancer when there is none. This can lead to having more tests that also have risks. It can also cause anxiety. You may be more likely to have a false-positive result if you are younger, have a family history of breast cancer, have had breast biopsies in the past, or take hormones. - False-negative results. These are tests that come back normal even though there is cancer. Women who have false-negative results do not know they have breast cancer and delay treatment. - Exposure to radiation is a risk factor for breast cancer. Mammograms expose your breasts to radiation. - Overtreatment. Mammograms and MRIs may find slow-growing cancers. These are cancers that may not shorten your life. At this time, it is not possible to know which cancers will grow and spread, so when cancer is found it is usually treated. Treatment can cause serious side effects.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Breast cancer (Symptoms): Early breast cancer often does not cause symptoms. This is why regular breast exams and mammograms are important, so cancers that don&apos;t have symptoms may be found earlier. As the cancer grows, symptoms may include: - Breast lump or lump in the armpit that is hard, has uneven edges, and usually does not hurt. - Change in the size, shape, or feel of the breast or nipple. For example, you may have redness, dimpling, or puckering that looks like the skin of an orange. - Fluid from the nipple. Fluid may be bloody, clear to yellow, green, or look like pus. In men, breast cancer symptoms include breast lump and breast pain and tenderness. Symptoms of advanced breast cancer may include: - Bone pain - Breast pain or discomfort - Skin ulcers - Swelling of the lymph nodes in the armpit (next to the breast with cancer) - Weight loss</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Familial breast cancer (Treatment): Management of familial breast cancer is generally focused on high-risk cancer screening to allow for early detection and treatment of cancer. In general, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends high-risk breast cancer screening for women who have: (1) a personal and family history suggestive of a hereditary cancer syndrome that is associated with breast cancer or (2) a greater than 20% risk of developing breast cancer in their lifetime based largely on family history. The recommended screening protocol includes: [4] Breast awareness and breast self-exams Clinical breast exams every 6-12 months beginning at age 30 or individualized based on the earliest breast cancer diagnosis in the family Annual mammogram and breast MRI beginning at age 30 or individualized based on the earliest breast cancer diagnosis in the family Discussion of other risk reduction strategies such as chemoprevention and/or prophylactic surgeries If the familial breast cancer is part of a known hereditary cancer syndrome, management will also include screening for the other associated cancers.

				<AnswerText>Recurrent breast cancer (Treatment): Your treatment options will depend on several factors, including the extent of the disease, its hormone receptor status, the type of treatment you received for your first breast cancer and your overall health. Your doctor also considers your goals and your preferences for treatment. Treating a local recurrence Treatment for a local recurrence typically starts with an operation and may include radiation if you haven&apos;t had it before. Chemotherapy and hormone therapy may also be recommended. - Surgery. For recurrent breast cancer that&apos;s confined to the breast, treatment usually involves removing any remaining breast tissue. If your first cancer was treated with lumpectomy, your doctor may recommend a mastectomy to remove all of your breast tissue - lobules, ducts, fatty tissue, skin and nipple. If your first breast cancer was treated with mastectomy and the cancer comes back in the chest wall, you may have surgery to remove the new cancer along with a margin of normal tissue. A local recurrence may be accompanied by hidden cancer in nearby lymph nodes. For this reason, the surgeon may remove some or all of the nearby lymph nodes if they weren&apos;t removed during your initial treatment. - Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams, such as X-rays, to kill cancer cells. If you didn&apos;t have radiation therapy for your first breast cancer, your doctor may recommend it now. But if you had radiation after a lumpectomy, radiation to treat the recurrence isn&apos;t usually recommended because of the risk of side effects. - Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Your doctor may recommend chemotherapy after surgery to reduce your risk of another cancer recurrence. - Hormone therapy. Medications that block the growth-promoting effects of the hormones estrogen and progesterone may be recommended if your cancer is hormone receptor positive. Treating a regional recurrence Treatments for a regional breast cancer recurrence include: - Surgery. If it&apos;s possible, surgery to remove the cancer is the recommended treatment for a regional recurrence. Your surgeon may also remove the lymph nodes under your arm if they&apos;re still present. - Radiation therapy. Sometimes radiation therapy may be used after surgery. If surgery isn&apos;t possible, radiation therapy may be used as the main treatment for a regional breast cancer recurrence. - Drug treatments. Chemotherapy, targeted therapy or hormone therapy also may be recommended as the main treatment or may follow surgery or radiation. Treating a metastatic recurrence Many treatments exist for metastatic breast cancer. Your options will depend on where your cancer has spread. If one treatment doesn&apos;t work or stops working, you may be able to try other treatments. In general, the goal of treatment for a metastatic breast cancer isn&apos;t to cure the disease. Treatment may allow you to live longer and can help relieve symptoms the cancer is causing. Your doctor works to achieve a balance between controlling your symptoms while minimizing toxic effects from treatment. The aim is to help you live as well as possible for as long as possible. Treatments may include: - Hormone therapy. If your cancer is hormone receptor positive, you may benefit from hormone therapy. In general, hormone therapy has fewer side effects than chemotherapy, so in many cases it&apos;s the first treatment used for metastatic breast cancer. - Chemotherapy. Your doctor may recommend chemotherapy if your cancer is hormone receptor negative or if hormone therapy is no longer working. - Targeted therapy. If your cancer cells have certain characteristics that make them vulnerable to targeted therapy, your doctor may recommend these medications. - Bone-building drugs. If cancer has spread to your bones, your doctor may recommend a bone-building drug to reduce your risk of broken bones or reduce bone pain you may experience. - Other treatments. Radiation therapy and surgery may be used in certain situations to control signs and symptoms of advanced breast cancer.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Breast Cancer (Treatment Options for Male Breast Cancer): Initial Surgery Treatment for men diagnosed with breast cancer is usually modified radical mastectomy. Breast-conserving surgery with lumpectomy may be used for some men. Adjuvant Therapy Therapy given after an operation when cancer cells can no longer be seen is called adjuvant therapy. Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, the patient may be given radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and/or targeted therapy after surgery, to try to kill any cancer cells that may be left. - Node-negative: For men whose cancer is node-negative (cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes), adjuvant therapy should be considered on the same basis as for a woman with breast cancer because there is no evidence that response to therapy is different for men and women. - Node-positive: For men whose cancer is node-positive (cancer has spread to the lymph nodes), adjuvant therapy may include the following: - Chemotherapy. - Targeted therapy with a monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab). - Tamoxifen (to block the effect of estrogen). - Other hormone therapy. These treatments appear to increase survival in men as they do in women. The patient&apos;s response to hormone therapy depends on whether there are hormone receptors (proteins) in the tumor. Most breast cancers in men have these receptors. Hormone therapy is usually recommended for male breast cancer patients, but it can have many side effects, including hot flashes and impotence (the inability to have an erection adequate for sexual intercourse). Distant Metastases Treatment options for metastatic breast cancer (cancer that has spread to distant parts of the body) may include the following: Hormone therapy In men who have just been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer that is hormone receptor positive or if the hormone receptor status is not known, treatment may include: - Tamoxifen therapy. - Aromatase inhibitor therapy (anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane) with or without an LHRH agonist. Sometimes cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor therapy (palbociclib) is also given. In men whose tumors are hormone receptor positive or hormone receptor unknown, with spread to the bone or soft tissue only, and who have been treated with tamoxifen, treatment may include: - Aromatase inhibitor therapy with or without LHRH agonist. - Other hormone therapy such as megestrol acetate, estrogen or androgen therapy, or anti-estrogen therapy such as fulvestrant. Targeted therapy In men with metastatic breast cancer that is hormone receptor positive and has not responded to other treatments, options may include targeted therapy such as: - Trastuzumab, lapatinib, pertuzumab, or mTOR inhibitors. - Antibody-drug conjugate therapy with ado-trastuzumab emtansine. - Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor therapy (palbociclib) combined with letrozole. In men with metastatic breast cancer that is HER2/neu positive, treatment may include: - Targeted therapy such as trastuzumab, pertuzumab, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, or lapatinib. Chemotherapy In men with metastatic breast cancer that is hormone receptor negative, has not responded to hormone therapy, has spread to other organs or has caused symptoms, treatment may include: - Chemotherapy with one or more drugs. Surgery - Total mastectomy for men with open or painful breast lesions. Radiation therapy may be given after surgery. - Surgery to remove cancer that has spread to the brain or spine. Radiation therapy may be given after surgery. - Surgery to remove cancer that has spread to the lung. - Surgery to repair or help support weak or broken bones. Radiation therapy may be given after surgery. - Surgery to remove fluid that has collected around the lungs or heart. Radiation therapy - Radiation therapy to the bones, brain, spinal cord, breast, or chest wall to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. - Strontium-89 (a radionuclide) to relieve pain from cancer that has spread to bones throughout the body. Other treatment options Other treatment options for metastatic breast cancer include: - Drug therapy with bisphosphonates or denosumab to reduce bone disease and pain when cancer has spread to the bone. (See the PDQ summary on Cancer Pain for more information about bisphosphonates.) - Clinical trials testing new anticancer drugs, new drug combinations, and new ways of giving treatment.

				<AnswerText>Breast cancer (Diagnosis): Diagnosing breast cancer Tests and procedures used to diagnose breast cancer include: - Breast exam. Your doctor will check both of your breasts and lymph nodes in your armpit, feeling for any lumps or other abnormalities. - Mammogram. A mammogram is an X-ray of the breast. Mammograms are commonly used to screen for breast cancer. If an abnormality is detected on a screening mammogram, your doctor may recommend a diagnostic mammogram to further evaluate that abnormality. - Breast ultrasound. Ultrasound uses sound waves to produce images of structures deep within the body. Ultrasound may be used to determine whether a new breast lump is a solid mass or a fluid-filled cyst. - Removing a sample of breast cells for testing (biopsy). A biopsy is the only definitive way to make a diagnosis of breast cancer. During a biopsy, your doctor uses a specialized needle device guided by X-ray or another imaging test to extract a core of tissue from the suspicious area. Often, a small metal marker is left at the site within your breast so the area can be easily identified on future imaging tests. Biopsy samples are sent to a laboratory for analysis where experts determine whether the cells are cancerous. A biopsy sample is also analyzed to determine the type of cells involved in the breast cancer, the aggressiveness (grade) of the cancer, and whether the cancer cells have hormone receptors or other receptors that may influence your treatment options. - Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI machine uses a magnet and radio waves to create pictures of the interior of your breast. Before a breast MRI, you receive an injection of dye. Unlike other types of imaging tests, an MRI doesn&apos;t use radiation to create the images. Other tests and procedures may be used depending on your situation. Staging breast cancer Once your doctor has diagnosed your breast cancer, he or she works to establish the extent (stage) of your cancer. Your cancer&apos;s stage helps determine your prognosis and the best treatment options. Complete information about your cancer&apos;s stage may not be available until after you undergo breast cancer surgery. Tests and procedures used to stage breast cancer may include: - Blood tests, such as a complete blood count - Mammogram of the other breast to look for signs of cancer - Breast MRI - Bone scan - Computerized tomography (CT) scan - Positron emission tomography (PET) scan Not all women will need all of these tests and procedures. Your doctor selects the appropriate tests based on your specific circumstances and taking into account new symptoms you may be experiencing. Breast cancer stages range from 0 to IV with 0 indicating cancer that is noninvasive or contained within the milk ducts. Stage IV breast cancer, also called metastatic breast cancer, indicates cancer that has spread to other areas of the body. Breast cancer staging also takes into account your cancer&apos;s grade; the presence of tumor markers, such as receptors for estrogen, progesterone and HER2; and proliferation factors.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Male breast cancer (Diagnosis): Diagnosing male breast cancer Your doctor may conduct a number of diagnostic tests and procedures, such as: - Clinical breast exam. The doctor uses his or her fingertips to examine your breasts and surrounding areas for lumps or other changes. Your doctor assesses how large the lumps are, how they feel, and how close they are to your skin and muscles. - Imaging tests. Mammogram and ultrasound can detect suspicious masses in your breast tissue. - Biopsy. A fine needle is inserted into the breast to remove tissue for analysis in the laboratory. Test results can reveal whether you have breast cancer and if so, the type of breast cancer you have. Determining the extent of the cancer Determining the extent (stage) of your cancer helps your doctor evaluate treatment options. Biopsy, blood tests and imaging tests can be used to stage male breast cancer. The stages of male breast cancer are: - Stage I. The tumor is no more than 2 centimeters (cm) in diameter (about 3/4 inch) and hasn&apos;t spread to the lymph nodes. - Stage II. The tumor may be up to 5 cm (about 2 inches) in diameter and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. Or the tumor may be larger than 5 cm but no cancer cells are found in the lymph nodes. - Stage III. The tumor may be larger than 5 cm (about 2 inches) in diameter and may involve several nearby lymph nodes. Lymph nodes above the collarbone may also contain cancer cells. - Stage IV. Cancer at this stage has spread beyond the breast to distant areas, such as the bone, brain, liver or lungs.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Heart Attack: Español A heart attack happens when the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart can’t get oxygen. If blood flow isn’t restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die. Heart attack treatment works best when it’s given right after symptoms occur. If you think you or someone else is having a heart attack, even if you’re not sure, call 9–1–1 right away. Overview Heart attacks most often occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD), also called coronary artery disease. CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis. The buildup of plaque occurs over many years. Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open) inside of an artery. This causes a blood clot to form on the plaque&apos;s surface. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery. If the blockage isn&apos;t treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. Healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems. Heart With Muscle Damage and a Blocked Artery A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery. Spasms can occur in coronary arteries that aren&apos;t affected by atherosclerosis. Heart attacks can be associated with or lead to severe health problems, such as heart failure and life-threatening arrhythmias. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can&apos;t pump enough blood to meet the body&apos;s needs. Arrhythmias are irregular heartbeats. Ventricular fibrillation is a life-threatening arrhythmia that can cause death if not treated right away. Don&apos;t Wait--Get Help Quickly Acting fast at the first sign of heart attack symptoms can save your life and limit damage to your heart. Treatment works best when it&apos;s given right after symptoms occur.   Many people aren&apos;t sure what&apos;s wrong when they are having symptoms of a heart attack. Some of the most common warning symptoms of a heart attack for both men and women are: Chest pain or discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest. The discomfort usually lasts more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion. Upper body discomfort. You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach (above the belly button). Shortness of breath. This may be your only symptom, or it may occur before or along with chest pain or discomfort. It can occur when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity. Other possible symptoms of a heart attack include: Breaking out in a cold sweat Feeling unusually tired for no reason, sometimes for days (especially if you are a woman) Nausea (feeling sick to the stomach) and vomiting Light-headedness or sudden dizziness Any sudden, new symptom or a change in the pattern of symptoms you already have (for example, if your symptoms become stronger or last longer than usual) Not all heart attacks begin with the sudden, crushing chest pain that often is shown on TV or in the movies, or other common symptoms such as chest discomfort. The symptoms of a heart attack can vary from person to person. Some people can have few symptoms and are surprised to learn they&apos;ve had a heart attack. If you&apos;ve already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one.  Quick Action Can Save Your Life: Call 9–1–1 If you think you or someone else may be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack, don&apos;t ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help. Call 9–1–1 for emergency medical care. Acting fast can save your life. Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. Take a nitroglycerin pill if your doctor has prescribed this type of treatment. Myocardial infarction (MI) Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) Acute coronary syndrome Coronary thrombosis Coronary occlusion Coronary Heart Disease A heart attack happens if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart can&apos;t get oxygen.

If the blockage isn&apos;t treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. Healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems. Coronary Artery Spasm A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery. Spasms can occur in coronary arteries that aren&apos;t affected by atherosclerosis. What causes a coronary artery to spasm isn&apos;t always clear. A spasm may be related to: Taking certain drugs, such as cocaine Emotional stress or pain Exposure to extreme cold Cigarette smoking Certain risk factors make it more likely that you&apos;ll develop coronary heart disease (CHD) and have a heart attack. You can control many of these risk factors. Risk Factors You Can Control The major risk factors for a heart attack that you can control include: Smoking High blood pressure High blood cholesterol Overweight and obesity An unhealthy diet (for example, a diet high in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, and sodium) Lack of routine physical activity High blood sugar due to insulin resistance or diabetes Some of these risk factors—such as obesity, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar—tend to occur together. When they do, it&apos;s called metabolic syndrome. In general, a person who has metabolic syndrome is twice as likely to develop heart disease and five times as likely to develop diabetes as someone who doesn&apos;t have metabolic syndrome. For more information about the risk factors that are part of metabolic syndrome, go to the Health Topics Metabolic Syndrome article. Risk Factors You Can&apos;t Control Risk factors that you can&apos;t control include: Age. The risk of heart disease increases for men after age 45 and for women after age 55 (or after menopause). Family history of early heart disease. Your risk increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with heart disease before 55 years of age, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with heart disease before 65 years of age. Preeclampsia (pre-e-KLAMP-se-ah). This condition can develop during pregnancy. The two main signs of preeclampsia are a rise in blood pressure and excess protein in the urine. Preeclampsia is linked to an increased lifetime risk of heart disease, including CHD, heart attack, heart failure, and high blood pressure. Not all heart attacks begin with the sudden, crushing chest pain that often is shown on TV or in the movies. In one study, for example, one-third of the patients who had heart attacks had no chest pain. These patients were more likely to be older, female, or diabetic. The symptoms of a heart attack can vary from person to person. Some people can have few symptoms and are surprised to learn they&apos;ve had a heart attack. If you&apos;ve already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. It is important for you to know the most common symptoms of a heart attack and also remember these facts: Heart attacks can start slowly and cause only mild pain or discomfort. Symptoms can be mild or more intense and sudden. Symptoms also may come and go over several hours. People who have high blood sugar (diabetes) may have no symptoms or very mild ones. The most common symptom, in both men and women, is chest pain or discomfort. Women are somewhat more likely to have shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, unusual tiredness (sometimes for days), and pain in the back, shoulders, and jaw. Some people don&apos;t have symptoms at all. Heart attacks that occur without any symptoms or with very mild symptoms are called silent heart attacks. Most Common Symptoms The most common warning symptoms of a heart attack for both men and women are: Chest pain or discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest. The discomfort usually lasts for more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion. The feeling can be mild or severe. Upper body discomfort. You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach (above the belly button). Shortness of breath. This may be your only symptom, or it may occur before or along with chest pain or discomfort. It can occur when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity. The symptoms of angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) can be similar to the symptoms of a heart attack. Angina is chest pain that occurs in people who have coronary heart disease, usually when they&apos;re active. Angina pain usually lasts for only a few minutes and goes away with rest. Chest pain or discomfort that doesn&apos;t go away or changes from its usual pattern (for example, occurs more often or while you&apos;re resting) can be a sign of a heart attack. All chest pain should be checked by a doctor. Other Common Signs and Symptoms Pay attention to these other possible symptoms of a heart attack: Breaking out in a cold sweat Feeling unusually tired for no reason, sometimes for days (especially if you are a woman) Nausea (feeling sick to the stomach) and vomiting Light-headedness or sudden dizziness Any sudden, new symptoms or a change in the pattern of symptoms you already have (for example, if your symptoms become stronger or last longer than usual) Not everyone having a heart attack has typical symptoms. If you&apos;ve already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. However, some people may have a pattern of symptoms that recur. The more signs and symptoms you have, the more likely it is that you&apos;re having a heart attack. Quick Action Can Save Your Life: Call 9–1–1  The signs and symptoms of a heart attack can develop suddenly. However, they also can develop slowly—sometimes within hours, days, or weeks of a heart attack. Any time you think you might be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack, don&apos;t ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help. Call 9–1–1 for emergency medical care, even if you are not sure whether you&apos;re having a heart attack. Here&apos;s why: Acting fast can save your life. An ambulance is the best and safest way to get to the hospital. Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel can check how you are doing and start life-saving medicines and other treatments right away. People who arrive by ambulance often receive faster treatment at the hospital.  The 9–1–1 operator or EMS technician can give you advice. You might be told to crush or chew an aspirin if you&apos;re not allergic, unless there is a medical reason for you not to take one. Aspirin taken during a heart attack can limit the damage to your heart and save your life. Every minute matters. Never delay calling 9–1–1 to take aspirin or do anything else you think might help. Your doctor will diagnose a heart attack based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and test results. Diagnostic Tests EKG (Electrocardiogram) An EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart&apos;s electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart. An EKG can show signs of heart damage due to coronary heart disease (CHD) and signs of a previous or current heart attack. Blood Tests During a heart attack, heart muscle cells die and release proteins into the bloodstream. Blood tests can measure the amount of these proteins in the bloodstream. Higher than normal levels of these proteins suggest a heart attack. Commonly used blood tests include troponin tests, CK or CK–MB tests, and serum myoglobin tests. Blood tests often are repeated to check for changes over time. Coronary Angiography Coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show the insides of your coronary arteries. This test often is done during a heart attack to help find blockages in the coronary arteries. To get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun). A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream. Special x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through the coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through the heart and blood vessels. If your doctor finds a blockage, he or she may recommend a procedure calledpercutaneous (per-ku-TA-ne-us) coronary intervention (PCI), sometimes referred to as coronary angioplasty (AN-jee-oh-plas-tee). This procedure can help restore blood flow through a blocked artery. Sometimes a small mesh tube called a stent is placed in the artery to help prevent blockages after the procedure. Early treatment for a heart attack can pr event or limit damage to the heart muscle. Acting fast, by calling 9–1–1 at the first symptoms of a heart attack, can save your life. Medical personnel can begin diagnosis and treatment even before you get to the hospital. Immediate Treatment Certain treatments usually are started right away if a heart attack is suspected, even before the diagnosis is confirmed. These include: Aspirin to prevent further blood clotting Nitroglycerin to reduce your heart’s workload and improve blood flow through the coronary arteries Oxygen therapy Treatment for chest pain Once the diagnosis of a heart attack is confirmed or strongly suspected, doctors start treatments promptly to try to restore blood flow through the blood vessels supplying the heart. The two main treatments are clot-busting medicines and percutaneous coronary intervention, also known as coronary angioplasty, a procedure used to open blocked coronary arteries. Clot-Busting Medicines Thrombolytic medicines, also called clot busters, are used to dissolve blood clots that are blocking the coronary arteries. To work best, these medicines must be given within several hours of the start of heart attack symptoms. Ideally, the medicine should be given as soon as possible. Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Percutaneous coronary intervention is a nonsurgical procedure that opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. A thin, flexible tube (catheter) with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel, usually in the groin (upper thigh), to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Once in place, the balloon located at the tip of the catheter is inflated to compress the plaque and related clot against the wall of the artery. This restores blood flow through the artery. During the procedure, the doctor may put a small mesh tube called a stent in the artery. The stent helps to keep the blood vessel open to prevent blockages in the artery in the months or years after the procedure. Other Treatments for Heart Attack Other treatments for heart attack include: Medicines Medical procedures Heart-healthy lifestyle changes Cardiac rehabilitation Medicines Your doctor may prescribe one or more of the following medicines. ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and reduce strain on your heart. They also help slow down further weakening of the heart muscle. Anticlotting medicines. Anticlotting medicines stop platelets from clumping together and forming unwanted blood clots. Examples of anticlotting medicines include aspirin and clopidogrel. Anticoagulants. Anticoagulants, or blood thinners, prevent blood clots from forming in your arteries. These medicines also keep existing clots from getting larger. Beta blockers. Beta blockers decrease your heart’s workload. These medicines also are used to relieve chest pain and discomfort and to help prevent another heart attack. Beta blockers also are used to treat arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats). Statin medicines. Statins control or lower your blood cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having another heart attack or stroke. You also may be given medicines to relieve pain and anxiety, and treat arrhythmias. Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Don’t change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to.  Medical Procedures Coronary artery bypass grafting also may be used to treat a heart attack. During coronary artery bypass grafting, a surgeon removes a healthy artery or vein from your body. The artery or vein is then connected, or grafted, to bypass the blocked section of the coronary artery. The grafted artery or vein bypasses (that is, goes around) the blocked portion of the coronary artery. This provides a new route for blood to flow to the heart muscle. Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes Treatment for a heart attack usually includes making heart-healthy lifestyle changes. Your doctor also may recommend: Heart-healthy eating Aiming for healthy weight Managing stress Physical activity Quitting smoking Taking these steps can lower your chances of having another heart attack. Cardiac Rehabilitation Your doctor may recommend cardiac rehabilitation (cardiac rehab) to help you recover from a heart attack and to help prevent another heart attack. Nearly everyone who has had a heart attack can benefit from rehab. Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that may help improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems. The cardiac rehab team may include doctors, nurses, exercise specialists, physical and occupational therapists, dietitians or nutritionists, and psychologists or other mental health specialists. Rehab has two parts: Education, counseling, and training. This part of rehab helps you understand your heart condition and find ways to reduce your risk for future heart problems. The rehab team will help you learn how to cope with the stress of adjusting to a new lifestyle and how to deal with your fears about the future. Exercise training. This part helps you learn how to exercise safely, strengthen your muscles, and improve your stamina. Your exercise plan will be based on your personal abilities, needs, and interests. Lowering your risk factors for coronary heart disease can help you prevent a heart attack. Even if you already have coronary heart disease, you still can take steps to lower your risk for a heart attack. These steps involve making heart-healthy lifestyle changes and getting ongoing medical care for related conditions that make heart attack more likely. Talk to your doctor about whether you may benefit from aspirin primary prevention, or using aspirin to help prevent your first heart attack. Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes A heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent a heart attack and includes heart-healthy eating, being physically active, quitting smoking, managing stress, and managing your weight. Ongoing Care Treat Related Conditions Treating conditions that make a heart attack more likely also can help lower your risk for a heart attack. These conditions may include: Diabetes (high blood sugar). If you have diabetes, try to control your blood sugar level through diet and physical activity (as your doctor recommends). If needed, take medicine as prescribed. High blood cholesterol. Your doctor may prescribe a statin medicine to lower your cholesterol if diet and exercise aren’t enough. High blood pressure. Your doctor may prescribe medicine to keep your blood pressure under control. Chronic kidney disease. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to control your high blood pressure or high blood sugar levels. Peripheral artery disease. Your doctor may recommend surgery or procedures to unblock the affected arteries. Have an Emergency Action Plan Make sure that you have an emergency action plan in case you or someone in your family has a heart attack. This is very important if you’re at high risk for, or have already had, a heart attack. Write down a list of medicines you are taking, medicines you are allergic to, your health care provider’s phone numbers (both during and after office hours), and contact information for a friend or relative. Keep the list in a handy place (for example, fill out this wallet card) to share in a medical emergency. Talk with your doctor about the signs and symptoms of a heart attack, when you should call 9–1–1, and steps you can take while waiting for medical help to arrive. Many people survive heart attacks and live active, full lives. If you get help quickly, treatment can limit damage to your heart muscle. Less heart damage improves your chances for a better quality of life after a heart attack. Medical Followup After a heart attack, you&apos;ll need treatment for coronary heart disease (CHD). This will help prevent another heart attack. Your doctor may recommend: Lifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet, being physically active, maintaining a healthy weight, and quitting smoking. Medicines to control chest pain or discomfort, high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and your heart&apos;s workload. Some of these medicines can help you prevent another heart attack. Anticlotting medicines, such as aspirin, that your doctor may prescribe to help you prevent another heart attack. A cardiac rehabilitation program If you find it hard to get your medicines or or complete your cardiac rehabilitation program, talk with your doctor. Don&apos;t stop the medicines or program because it can help you prevent another heart attack. Returning to Normal Activities After a heart attack, most people who don&apos;t have chest pain or discomfort or other problems can safely return to most of their normal activities within a few weeks. Most can begin walking right away. Sexual activity also can begin within a few weeks for most patients. Talk with your doctor about a safe schedule for returning to your normal routine. If allowed by State law, driving usually can begin within a week for most patients who don&apos;t have chest pain or discomfort or other disabling problems. Each State has rules about driving a motor vehicle following a serious illness. People who have complications shouldn&apos;t drive until their symptoms have been stable for a few weeks. Anxiety and Depression After a Heart Attack After a heart attack, many people worry about having another heart attack. Sometimes they feel depressed and have trouble adjusting to new lifestyle changes. Talk about how you feel with your health care team. Talking to a professional counselor also can help. If you&apos;re very depressed, your doctor may recommend medicines or other treatments that can improve your quality of life. Joining a patient support group may help you adjust to life after a heart attack. You can see how other people who have the same symptoms have coped with them. Talk with your doctor about local support groups or check with an area medical center. Support from family and friends also can help relieve stress and anxiety. Let your loved ones know how you feel and what they can do to help you. Risk of a Repeat Heart Attack Once you&apos;ve had a heart attack, you&apos;re at higher risk for another one. Knowing the difference between angina and a heart attack is important. Angina is chest pain that occurs in people who have CHD. The pain from angina usually occurs after physical exertion and goes away in a few minutes when you rest or take medicine as directed. The pain from a heart attack usually is more severe than the pain from angina. Heart attack pain doesn&apos;t go away when you rest or take medicine. If you don&apos;t know whether your chest pain is angina or a heart attack, call 9–1–1. The symptoms of a second heart attack may not be the same as those of a first heart attack. Don&apos;t take a chance if you&apos;re in doubt. Always call 9–1–1 right away if you or someone else has heart attack symptoms. Unfortunately, most heart attack victims wait 2 hours or more after their symptoms start before they seek medical help. This delay can result in lasting heart damage or death.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What is Heart attack first aid?: A heart attack is a medical emergency. Call 911 or your local emergency number if you think you or someone else is having a heart attack. The average person waits 3 hours before seeking help for symptoms of a heart attack. Many heart attack patients die before they reach a hospital. The sooner the person gets to the emergency room, the better the chance of survival. Prompt medical treatment reduces the amount of heart damage. This article discusses what to do if you think someone may be having a heart attack.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Heart attack: A heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is blocked, most often by a build-up of fat, cholesterol and other substances, which form a plaque in the arteries that feed the heart (coronary arteries). The interrupted blood flow can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle. A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, can be fatal, but treatment has improved dramatically over the years. It&apos;s crucial to call 911 or emergency medical help if you think you might be having a heart attack. Common heart attack signs and symptoms include: - Pressure, tightness, pain, or a squeezing or aching sensation in your chest or arms that may spread to your neck, jaw or back - Nausea, indigestion, heartburn or abdominal pain - Shortness of breath - Cold sweat - Fatigue - Lightheadedness or sudden dizziness Heart attack symptoms vary Not all people who have heart attacks have the same symptoms or have the same severity of symptoms. Some people have mild pain; others have more severe pain. Some people have no symptoms, while for others, the first sign may be sudden cardiac arrest. However, the more signs and symptoms you have, the greater the likelihood you&apos;re having a heart attack. Some heart attacks strike suddenly, but many people have warning signs and symptoms hours, days or weeks in advance. The earliest warning may be recurrent chest pain (angina) that&apos;s triggered by exertion and relieved by rest. Angina is caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the heart. A heart attack differs from a condition in which your heart suddenly stops (sudden cardiac arrest, which occurs when an electrical disturbance disrupts your heart&apos;s pumping action and causes blood to stop flowing to the rest of your body). A heart attack can cause cardiac arrest, but it&apos;s not the only cause. When to see a doctor Act immediately. Some people wait too long because they don&apos;t recognize the important signs and symptoms. Take these steps: - Call for emergency medical help. If you suspect you&apos;re having a heart attack, don&apos;t hesitate. Immediately call 911 or your local emergency number. If you don&apos;t have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only if there are no other options. Because your condition can worsen, driving yourself puts you and others at risk. - Take nitroglycerin, if prescribed to you by a doctor. Take it as instructed while awaiting emergency help. - Take aspirin, if recommended. Taking aspirin during a heart attack could reduce heart damage by helping to keep your blood from clotting. Aspirin can interact with other medications, however, so don&apos;t take an aspirin unless your doctor or emergency medical personnel recommend it. Don&apos;t delay calling 911 to take an aspirin. Call for emergency help first. What to do if you see someone having a heart attack If you encounter someone who is unconscious, first call for emergency medical help. Then begin CPR to keep blood flowing. Push hard and fast on the person&apos;s chest in a fairly rapid rhythm - about 100 to 120 compressions a minute. It&apos;s not necessary to check the person&apos;s airway or deliver rescue breaths unless you&apos;ve been trained in CPR. A heart attack occurs when one or more of your coronary arteries become blocked. Over time, a coronary artery can narrow from the buildup of various substances, including cholesterol (atherosclerosis). This condition, known as coronary artery disease, causes most heart attacks. During a heart attack, one of these plaques can rupture and spill cholesterol and other substances into the bloodstream. A blood clot forms at the site of the rupture. If large enough, the clot can completely block the flow of blood through the coronary artery. Another cause of a heart attack is a spasm of a coronary artery that shuts down blood flow to part of the heart muscle. Use of tobacco and of illicit drugs, such as cocaine, can cause a life-threatening spasm. A heart attack can also occur due to a tear in the heart artery (spontaneous coronary artery dissection). Certain factors contribute to the unwanted buildup of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) that narrows arteries throughout your body. You can improve or eliminate many of these risk factors to reduce your chances of having a first or subsequent heart attack. Heart attack risk factors include: - Age. Men age 45 or older and women age 55 or older are more likely to have a heart attack than are younger men and women. - Tobacco. Smoking and long-term exposure to secondhand smoke increase the risk of a heart attack. - High blood pressure. Over time, high blood pressure can damage arteries that feed your heart by accelerating atherosclerosis. High blood pressure that occurs with obesity, smoking, high cholesterol or diabetes increases your risk even more. - High blood cholesterol or triglyceride levels. A high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (the &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol) is most likely to narrow arteries. A high level of triglycerides, a type of blood fat related to your diet, also ups your risk of heart attack. However, a high level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the &quot;good&quot; cholesterol) lowers your risk of heart attack. - Diabetes. Insulin, a hormone secreted by your pancreas, allows your body to use glucose, a form of sugar. Having diabetes - not producing enough insulin or not responding to insulin properly - causes your body&apos;s blood sugar levels to rise. Diabetes, especially uncontrolled, increases your risk of a heart attack. - Family history of heart attack. If your siblings, parents or grandparents have had early heart attacks (by age 55 for male relatives and by age 65 for female relatives), you may be at increased risk. - Lack of physical activity. An inactive lifestyle contributes to high blood cholesterol levels and obesity. People who get regular aerobic exercise have better cardiovascular fitness, which decreases their overall risk of heart attack. Exercise is also beneficial in lowering high blood pressure. - Obesity. Obesity is associated with high blood cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, high blood pressure and diabetes. Losing just 10 percent of your body weight can lower this risk, however. - Stress. You may respond to stress in ways that can increase your risk of a heart attack. - Illegal drug use. Using stimulant drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines, can trigger a spasm of your coronary arteries that can cause a heart attack. - A history of preeclampsia. This condition causes high blood pressure during pregnancy and increases the lifetime risk of heart disease. - A history of an autoimmune condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and other autoimmune conditions can increase your risk of having a heart attack. Complications are often related to the damage done to your heart during an attack. Damage can lead to: - Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). Electrical &quot;short circuits&quot; can develop, resulting in abnormal heart rhythms, some of which can be serious, even fatal. - Heart failure. An attack may damage so much heart tissue that the remaining heart muscle can&apos;t adequately pump blood out of your heart. Heart failure may be temporary, or it can be a chronic condition resulting from extensive and permanent damage to your heart. - Heart rupture. Areas of heart muscle weakened by a heart attack can rupture, leaving a hole in part of the heart. This rupture is often fatal. - Valve problems. Heart valves damaged during a heart attack may develop severe leakage problems. Ideally, your doctor should screen you during regular physical exams for risk factors that can lead to a heart attack. If you&apos;re in an emergency setting for symptoms of a heart attack, you&apos;ll be asked to describe your symptoms and have your blood pressure, pulse and temperature checked. You&apos;ll be hooked up to a heart monitor and will almost immediately have tests to see if you&apos;re having a heart attack. Tests will help check if your signs and symptoms, such as chest pain, indicate a heart attack or another condition. These tests include: - Electrocardiogram (ECG). This first test done to diagnose a heart attack records the electrical activity of your heart via electrodes attached to your skin. Impulses are recorded as waves displayed on a monitor or printed on paper. Because injured heart muscle doesn&apos;t conduct electrical impulses normally, the ECG may show that a heart attack has occurred or is in progress. - Blood tests. Certain heart enzymes slowly leak out into your blood if your heart has been damaged by a heart attack. Emergency room doctors will take samples of your blood to test for the presence of these enzymes. Additional tests If you&apos;ve had a heart attack or one is occurring, doctors will take immediate steps to treat your condition. You may also undergo these additional tests: - Chest X-ray. An X-ray image of your chest allows your doctor to check the size of your heart and its blood vessels and to look for fluid in your lungs. - Echocardiogram. During this test, sound waves directed at your heart from a wandlike device (transducer) held on your chest bounce off your heart and are processed electronically to provide video images of your heart. An echocardiogram can help identify whether an area of your heart has been damaged by a heart attack and isn&apos;t pumping normally or at peak capacity. - Coronary catheterization (angiogram). A liquid dye is injected into the arteries of your heart through a long, thin tube (catheter) that&apos;s fed through an artery, usually in your leg or groin, to the arteries in your heart. The dye makes the arteries visible on X-ray, revealing areas of blockage. - Exercise stress test. In the days or weeks after your heart attack, you may also undergo a stress test. Stress tests measure how your heart and blood vessels respond to exertion. You may walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bike while attached to an ECG machine. Or you may receive a drug intravenously that stimulates your heart similar to exercise. Your doctor may also order a nuclear stress test, which is similar to an exercise stress test, but uses an injected dye and special imaging techniques to produce detailed images of your heart while you&apos;re exercising. These tests can help determine your long-term treatment. - Cardiac computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These tests can be used to diagnose heart problems, including the extent of damage from heart attacks. In a cardiac CT scan, you lie on a table inside a doughnut-shaped machine. An X-ray tube inside the machine rotates around your body and collects images of your heart and chest. In a cardiac MRI, you lie on a table inside a long tubelike machine that produces a magnetic field. The magnetic field aligns atomic particles in some of your cells. When radio waves are broadcast toward these aligned particles, they produce signals that vary according to the type of tissue they are. The signals create images of your heart. Heart attack treatment at a hospital With each passing minute after a heart attack, more heart tissue loses oxygen and deteriorates or dies. The main way to prevent heart damage is to restore blood flow quickly. Medications Medications given to treat a heart attack include: - Aspirin. The 911 operator may instruct you to take aspirin, or emergency medical personnel may give you aspirin immediately. Aspirin reduces blood clotting, thus helping maintain blood flow through a narrowed artery. - Thrombolytics. These drugs, also called clotbusters, help dissolve a blood clot that&apos;s blocking blood flow to your heart. The earlier you receive a thrombolytic drug after a heart attack, the greater the chance you&apos;ll survive and with less heart damage. - Antiplatelet agents. Emergency room doctors may give you other drugs to help prevent new clots and keep existing clots from getting larger. These include medications, such as clopidogrel (Plavix) and others, called platelet aggregation inhibitors. - Other blood-thinning medications. You&apos;ll likely be given other medications, such as heparin, to make your blood less &quot;sticky&quot; and less likely to form clots. Heparin is given intravenously or by an injection under your skin. - Pain relievers. You may receive a pain reliever, such as morphine, to ease your discomfort. - Nitroglycerin. This medication, used to treat chest pain (angina), can help improve blood flow to the heart by widening (dilating) the blood vessels. - Beta blockers. These medications help relax your heart muscle, slow your heartbeat and decrease blood pressure, making your heart&apos;s job easier. Beta blockers can limit the amount of heart muscle damage and prevent future heart attacks. - ACE inhibitors. These drugs lower blood pressure and reduce stress on the heart. Surgical and other procedures In addition to medications, you may undergo one of the following procedures to treat your heart attack: - Coronary angioplasty and stenting. Doctors insert a long, thin tube (catheter) that&apos;s passed through an artery, usually in your leg or groin, to a blocked artery in your heart. If you&apos;ve had a heart attack, this procedure is often done immediately after a cardiac catheterization, a procedure used to locate blockages. This catheter is equipped with a special balloon that, once in position, is briefly inflated to open a blocked coronary artery. A metal mesh stent may be inserted into the artery to keep it open long term, restoring blood flow to the heart. Depending on your condition, your doctor may opt to place a stent coated with a slow-releasing medication to help keep your artery open. - Coronary artery bypass surgery. In some cases, doctors may perform emergency bypass surgery at the time of a heart attack. If possible, your doctor may suggest that you have bypass surgery after your heart has had time - about three to seven days - to recover from your heart attack. Bypass surgery involves sewing veins or arteries in place beyond a blocked or narrowed coronary artery, allowing blood flow to the heart to bypass the narrowed section. Once blood flow to your heart is restored and your condition is stable, you&apos;re likely to remain in the hospital for several days. Your lifestyle affects your heart health. The following steps can help you not only prevent but also recover from a heart attack: - Avoid smoke. The most important thing you can do to improve your heart&apos;s health is to not smoke. Also, avoid being around secondhand smoke. If you need to quit, ask your doctor for help. - Control your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. If one or both of these is high, your doctor can prescribe changes to your diet and medications. Ask your doctor how often you need to have your blood pressure and cholesterol levels monitored. - Get regular medical checkups. Some of the major risk factors for heart attack - high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes - cause no symptoms early on. Your doctor can perform tests to check for these conditions and help you manage them, if necessary. - Exercise regularly. Regular exercise helps improve heart muscle function after a heart attack and helps prevent a heart attack by helping you to control your weight, diabetes, cholesterol and blood pressure. Exercise needn&apos;t be vigorous. Walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week can improve your health. - Maintain a healthy weight. Excess weight strains your heart and can contribute to high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. - Eat a heart-healthy diet. Saturated fat, trans fats and cholesterol in your diet can narrow arteries to your heart, and too much salt can raise blood pressure. Eat a heart-healthy diet that includes lean proteins, such as fish and beans, plenty of fruits and vegetables and whole grains. - Manage diabetes. High blood sugar is damaging to your heart. Regular exercise, eating well and losing weight all help to keep blood sugar levels at more-desirable levels. Many people also need medication to manage their diabetes. - Control stress. Reduce stress in your day-to-day activities. Rethink workaholic habits and find healthy ways to minimize or deal with stressful events in your life. - If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and men older than age 65, and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Heart attack - what to ask your doctor: A heart attack occurs when blood flow to a part of your heart is blocked for a period of time and a part of the heart muscle is damaged. It is also called a myocardial infarction (MI). Watch this video about: Coronary artery disease Angina is pain or pressure in the chest. It occurs when your heart muscle is not getting enough blood or oxygen. You may feel angina in your neck or jaw. Sometimes you may notice that you are short of breath. Below are some questions you may want to ask your health care provider to help you take care of yourself after a heart attack. What are the signs and symptoms that I am having angina? Will I always have the same symptoms? - What are the activities that can cause me to have angina? - How should I treat my chest pain or angina when it happens? - When should I call the doctor? - When should I call 911? How much activity is ok for me? - Can I walk around the house? Is it ok to go up and down stairs? When can I start light housework or cooking? How much can I lift or carry? How much sleep do I need? - Which activities are better to start with? Are there activities that are not safe for me? - Is it safe for me to exercise on my own? Should I exercise inside or outside? - How long and how hard can I exercise? Do I need to have a stress test? Do I need to go to a cardiac rehabilitation program? When can I return to work? Are there limits on what I can do at work? What should I do if I feel sad or very worried about my heart disease? How can I change the way I live to make my heart healthier? - What is a heart-healthy diet? Is it ok to ever eat something that is not heart healthy? How can I make heart-healthy choices when I go eat out? - Is it OK to drink alcohol? How much? - Is it OK to be around other people who are smoking? - Is my blood pressure normal? - What is my cholesterol? Do l need to take medicines for it? Is it OK to be sexually active? Is it safe to use sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), or tadalafil (Cialis) for erection problems? What medicines am I taking to treat angina? - Do they have any side effects? - What should I do if I miss a dose? - Is it ever safe to stop taking any of these medicines on my own? If I am taking a blood thinner such as aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), can I use medicines such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) for arthritis, headaches, or other pain problems?

				<AnswerText>Aspirin to Prevent a First Heart Attack or Stroke: Also known as aspirin primary prevention. Aspirin is a proven way to help some people prevent a second heart attack or stroke. When aspirin is used this way it is called aspirin secondary prevention. It appears that aspirin also may help prevent a first heart attack or stroke in some people. Learn more about what we know about aspirin primary prevention, or the use of aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke. Who may benefit? Aspirin primary prevention is not right for everyone. Aspirin primary prevention may be beneficial for adults who: Are 50 to 69 years old, with the greatest benefit for adults aged 50 to 59; Have a 10 percent or higher risk of cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years; and Are able and willing to take low-dose aspirin, about 81 mg per day, for at least 10 years. Currently, there is not enough evidence to: Support the use of aspirin primary prevention in patients who are younger than 50 years or older than 70 years. Know whether aspirin primary prevention benefits or risks differ between men and women or between different races or ethnicities. Talk to your doctor to find out whether aspirin is right for you to help prevent heart attack, stroke, or other conditions. Do not start aspirin without first talking with your doctor about your risks and benefits. There are conditions, such as atrial fibrillation and deep vein thrombosis, where aspirin alone would not be enough protection. If you have either of these conditions, be sure to talk with your doctor about what prevention method is best for you. Read more Why does aspirin prevent heart attack and stroke? Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly used to relieve pain. But, aspirin also may prevent the formation of blood clots. Aspirin does this by inhibiting platelets from promoting clotting in blood vessels where cholesterol and plaque may be partially blocking blood flow. This clotting can lead to heart attack and stroke. By inhibiting clotting, aspirin helps reduce damage to the heart and brain and helps prevent heart attack and stroke. What are the risks? Bleeding is the most common side effect of aspirin. The risk of bleeding is higher in men versus women, and the risk increases in patients who: Are older Are using aspirin at a higher dose or for longer periods of time Are using aspirin at the same time as other medicines that increase the risk of bleeding Have uncontrolled high blood pressure Have or previously had ulcers in their gastrointestinal tract Have other medical conditions such as kidney failure, liver disease, and certain bleeding or blood disorders Some patients with severe asthma may be sensitive to aspirin. These patients may experience serious respiratory problems when taking aspirin. Talk to your doctor to find out whether aspirin is right for you. Don’t start taking aspirin without first talking to your doctor. Read more Why does aspirin cause bleeding as a side effect and is it serious? Aspirin can cause bleeding in many parts of the body, particularly in the brain or in the gastrointestinal tract including the stomach. This can happen because aspirin can make it easier for the stomach lining to be damaged and bleed. Because aspirin also inhibits clotting, bleeding in the stomach or brain can be fatal if left untreated and it requires immediate medical attention. What if I’m taking aspirin to prevent another heart attack or stroke? The information discussed in Who may benefit? only applies to use of aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke. Aspirin is a proven way to prevent a second heart attack or stroke in some people. If you’ve already had a heart attack or stroke and are already taking aspirin to prevent another event, do not stop taking your aspirin without talking to your doctor. How else can you prevent heart attack and stroke? Heart-healthy lifestyle changes can help prevent a heart attack and stroke. These changes include: Heart-healthy eating Being physically active Quitting smoking Managing stress Aiming for a health weight It is also important to control other medical conditions that increase your risk of heart attack or stroke, such as high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, preeclampsia, and overweight and obesity. You and your doctor should monitor your cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar numbers to know if you are at risk for a first heart attack or stroke or if you are meeting goals to help prevent another event. Can aspirin prevent other conditions? Aspirin also may prevent: Colorectal cancer in some patients. Read Colorectal Cancer Prevention (PDQ®) – Patient Version for more information from the National Cancer Institute. Preeclampsia when used after the first trimester in pregnant women who are high risk for this pregnancy-related condition. Read An Aspirin a Day for Preeclampsia Prevention for more information from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Repeat deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism events in patients who discontinue anticoagulants. Aspirin is not preferred over other anticlotting medicines, but aspirin may be beneficial over no therapy to prevent another blood clot that causes deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

				<AnswerText>Heart attack: Most heart attacks are caused by a blood clot that blocks one of the coronary arteries. The coronary arteries bring blood and oxygen to the heart. If the blood flow is blocked, the heart is starved of oxygen and heart cells die. The medical term for this is myocardial infarction. A substance called plaque can build up in the walls of your coronary arteries. This plaque is made up of cholesterol and other cells. A heart attack may occur when: - A tear in the plaque occurs. This triggers blood platelets and other substances to form a blood clot at the site that blocks most or all of the oxygen-carrying blood from flowing to a part of the heart muscle. This is the most common cause of heart attack. - A slow buildup of plaque may narrow one of the coronary arteries so that it is almost blocked. In either case, there is not enough blood flow to the heart muscle and heart muscle dies. The cause of heart attack is not always known. Heart attack may occur: - When you are resting or asleep - After a sudden increase in physical activity - When you are active outside in cold weather - After sudden, severe emotional or physical stress, including an illness Many risk factors may lead to the development of plaque buildup and a heart attack. A heart attack is a medical emergency. If you have symptoms of a heart attack, call 911 or your local emergency number right away. - DO NOT try to drive yourself to the hospital. - DO NOT WAIT. You are at greatest risk of sudden death in the early hours of a heart attack. Chest pain is the most common symptom of a heart attack. - You may feel the pain in only one part of your body OR - Pain may move from your chest to your arms, shoulder, neck, teeth, jaw, belly area, or back The pain can be severe or mild. It can feel like: - A tight band around the chest - Bad indigestion - Something heavy sitting on your chest - Squeezing or heavy pressure The pain most often lasts longer than 20 minutes. Rest and a medicine to relax the blood vessels (called nitroglycerin) may not completely relieve the pain of a heart attack. Symptoms may also go away and come back. Other symptoms of a heart attack can include: - Anxiety - Cough - Fainting - Lightheadedness, dizziness - Nausea and vomiting - Palpitations (feeling like your heart is beating too fast or irregularly) - Shortness of breath - Sweating, which may be very heavy Some people (the older adults, people with diabetes, and women) may have little or no chest pain. Or, they may have unusual symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and weakness. A &quot;silent heart attack&quot; is a heart attack with no symptoms. A health care provider will perform a physical exam and listen to your chest using a stethoscope. - The provider may hear abnormal sounds in your lungs (called crackles), a heart murmur, or other abnormal sounds. - You may have a fast or uneven pulse. - Your blood pressure may be normal, high, or low. You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG) to look for heart damage. Most of the time, certain changes on the ECG indicate you are having a heart attack. Sometimes these changes are not present, even though other tests indicate you have had a heart attack. This can be called non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). A blood test can show if you have heart tissue damage. This test can confirm that you are having a heart attack. You will likely have this test 3 times over the first 6 to 12 hours. Coronary angiography may be done right away or when you are more stable. - This test uses a special dye and x-rays to see how blood flows through your heart. - It can help your doctor decide which treatments you need next. Other tests to look at your heart that may be done while you are in the hospital: - Echocardiography with or with stress testing - Exercise stress test - Nuclear stress test - Heart CT scan or heart MRI IMMEDIATE TREATMENT - You will be hooked up to a heart monitor, so the health care team can see how regularly your heart is beating. - You will receive oxygen so that your heart doesn&apos;t have to work as hard. - An intravenous line (IV) will be placed into one of your veins. Medicines and fluids pass through this IV. - You may get nitroglycerin and morphine to help reduce chest pain. - You may receive aspirin, unless it would not be safe for you. In that case, you will be given another medicine that prevents blood clots. - Dangerous abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) may be treated with medicine or electric shocks. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. - Angioplasty is often the first choice of treatment. It should be done within 90 minutes after you get to the hospital, and usually no later than 12 hours after a heart attack. - A stent is a small, metal mesh tube that opens up (expands) inside a coronary artery. A stent is usually placed after or during angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again. You may be given drugs to break up the clot. This is called thrombolytic therapy. It is best if these drugs are given soon after the onset of symptoms, usually no later than 12 hours after it and ideally within 30 minutes of arriving to the hospital. Some people may also have heart bypass surgery to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. This procedure is also called coronary artery bypass grafting and/or open heart surgery. TREATMENT AFTER A HEART ATTACK After several days, you will be discharged from the hospital. You will likely need to take medicines, some for the rest of your life. Always talk to your provider before stopping or changing how you take any medicines. Stopping certain medicines can be deadly. While under the care of your health care team, you will learn: - How to take medicines to treat your heart problem and prevent more heart attacks - How to eat a heart-healthy diet - How to be active and exercise safely - What to do when you have chest pain - How to stop smoking Strong emotions are common after a heart attack. - You may feel sad - You may feel anxious and worry about being careful about everything you do All of these feelings are normal. They go away for most people after 2 or 3 weeks. You may also feel tired when you leave the hospital to go home. Most people who have had a heart attack take part in a cardiac rehabilitation program. Many people benefit from taking part in support groups for people with heart disease. After a heart attack, you have a higher chance of having another heart attack. How well you do after a heart attack depends on several factors such as: - The amount of damage to your heart muscle and heart valves - Where that damage is located - Your medical care after the heart attack If your heart can no longer pump blood out to your body as well as it used to, you may develop heart failure. Abnormal heart rhythms can occur, and they can be life threatening. Most people can slowly go back to normal activities after a heart attack. This includes sexual activity. Talk to your provider about how much activity is good for you. Updated by: Michael A.

				<AnswerURL>https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/heartattack</AnswerURL>
				<AnswerText>Heart Attack (Signs and Symptoms): Not all heart attacks begin with the sudden, crushing chest pain that often is shown on TV or in the movies. In one study, for example, one-third of the patients who had heart attacks had no chest pain. These patients were more likely to be older, female, or diabetic. The symptoms of a heart attack can vary from person to person. Some people can have few symptoms and are surprised to learn they&apos;ve had a heart attack. If you&apos;ve already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. It is important for you to know the most common symptoms of a heart attack and also remember these facts: Heart attacks can start slowly and cause only mild pain or discomfort. Symptoms can be mild or more intense and sudden. Symptoms also may come and go over several hours. People who have high blood sugar (diabetes) may have no symptoms or very mild ones. The most common symptom, in both men and women, is chest pain or discomfort. Women are somewhat more likely to have shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, unusual tiredness (sometimes for days), and pain in the back, shoulders, and jaw. Some people don&apos;t have symptoms at all. Heart attacks that occur without any symptoms or with very mild symptoms are called silent heart attacks. Most Common Symptoms The most common warning symptoms of a heart attack for both men and women are: Chest pain or discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest. The discomfort usually lasts for more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion. The feeling can be mild or severe. Upper body discomfort. You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach (above the belly button). Shortness of breath. This may be your only symptom, or it may occur before or along with chest pain or discomfort. It can occur when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity. The symptoms of angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) can be similar to the symptoms of a heart attack. Angina is chest pain that occurs in people who have coronary heart disease, usually when they&apos;re active. Angina pain usually lasts for only a few minutes and goes away with rest. Chest pain or discomfort that doesn&apos;t go away or changes from its usual pattern (for example, occurs more often or while you&apos;re resting) can be a sign of a heart attack. All chest pain should be checked by a doctor. Other Common Signs and Symptoms Pay attention to these other possible symptoms of a heart attack: Breaking out in a cold sweat Feeling unusually tired for no reason, sometimes for days (especially if you are a woman) Nausea (feeling sick to the stomach) and vomiting Light-headedness or sudden dizziness Any sudden, new symptoms or a change in the pattern of symptoms you already have (for example, if your symptoms become stronger or last longer than usual) Not everyone having a heart attack has typical symptoms. If you&apos;ve already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. However, some people may have a pattern of symptoms that recur. The more signs and symptoms you have, the more likely it is that you&apos;re having a heart attack. Quick Action Can Save Your Life: Call 9–1–1  The signs and symptoms of a heart attack can develop suddenly. However, they also can develop slowly—sometimes within hours, days, or weeks of a heart attack. Any time you think you might be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack, don&apos;t ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help. Call 9–1–1 for emergency medical care, even if you are not sure whether you&apos;re having a heart attack. Here&apos;s why: Acting fast can save your life. An ambulance is the best and safest way to get to the hospital. Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel can check how you are doing and start life-saving medicines and other treatments right away. People who arrive by ambulance often receive faster treatment at the hospital.  The 9–1–1 operator or EMS technician can give you advice. You might be told to crush or chew an aspirin if you&apos;re not allergic, unless there is a medical reason for you not to take one. Aspirin taken during a heart attack can limit the damage to your heart and save your life. Every minute matters. Never delay calling 9–1–1 to take aspirin or do anything else you think might help.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Heart Attack (Life After): Many people survive heart attacks and live active, full lives. If you get help quickly, treatment can limit damage to your heart muscle. Less heart damage improves your chances for a better quality of life after a heart attack. Medical Followup After a heart attack, you&apos;ll need treatment for coronary heart disease (CHD). This will help prevent another heart attack. Your doctor may recommend: Lifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet, being physically active, maintaining a healthy weight, and quitting smoking. Medicines to control chest pain or discomfort, high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and your heart&apos;s workload. Some of these medicines can help you prevent another heart attack. Anticlotting medicines, such as aspirin, that your doctor may prescribe to help you prevent another heart attack. A cardiac rehabilitation program If you find it hard to get your medicines or or complete your cardiac rehabilitation program, talk with your doctor. Don&apos;t stop the medicines or program because it can help you prevent another heart attack. Returning to Normal Activities After a heart attack, most people who don&apos;t have chest pain or discomfort or other problems can safely return to most of their normal activities within a few weeks. Most can begin walking right away. Sexual activity also can begin within a few weeks for most patients. Talk with your doctor about a safe schedule for returning to your normal routine. If allowed by State law, driving usually can begin within a week for most patients who don&apos;t have chest pain or discomfort or other disabling problems. Each State has rules about driving a motor vehicle following a serious illness. People who have complications shouldn&apos;t drive until their symptoms have been stable for a few weeks. Anxiety and Depression After a Heart Attack After a heart attack, many people worry about having another heart attack. Sometimes they feel depressed and have trouble adjusting to new lifestyle changes. Talk about how you feel with your health care team. Talking to a professional counselor also can help. If you&apos;re very depressed, your doctor may recommend medicines or other treatments that can improve your quality of life. Joining a patient support group may help you adjust to life after a heart attack. You can see how other people who have the same symptoms have coped with them. Talk with your doctor about local support groups or check with an area medical center. Support from family and friends also can help relieve stress and anxiety. Let your loved ones know how you feel and what they can do to help you. Risk of a Repeat Heart Attack Once you&apos;ve had a heart attack, you&apos;re at higher risk for another one. Knowing the difference between angina and a heart attack is important. Angina is chest pain that occurs in people who have CHD. The pain from angina usually occurs after physical exertion and goes away in a few minutes when you rest or take medicine as directed. The pain from a heart attack usually is more severe than the pain from angina. Heart attack pain doesn&apos;t go away when you rest or take medicine. If you don&apos;t know whether your chest pain is angina or a heart attack, call 9–1–1. The symptoms of a second heart attack may not be the same as those of a first heart attack. Don&apos;t take a chance if you&apos;re in doubt. Always call 9–1–1 right away if you or someone else has heart attack symptoms. Unfortunately, most heart attack victims wait 2 hours or more after their symptoms start before they seek medical help. This delay can result in lasting heart damage or death.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Heart attack: A heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is blocked, most often by a build-up of fat, cholesterol and other substances, which form a plaque in the arteries that feed the heart (coronary arteries). The interrupted blood flow can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle. A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, can be fatal, but treatment has improved dramatically over the years. It&apos;s crucial to call 911 or emergency medical help if you think you might be having a heart attack. Common heart attack signs and symptoms include: - Pressure, tightness, pain, or a squeezing or aching sensation in your chest or arms that may spread to your neck, jaw or back - Nausea, indigestion, heartburn or abdominal pain - Shortness of breath - Cold sweat - Fatigue - Lightheadedness or sudden dizziness Heart attack symptoms vary Not all people who have heart attacks have the same symptoms or have the same severity of symptoms. Some people have mild pain; others have more severe pain. Some people have no symptoms, while for others, the first sign may be sudden cardiac arrest. However, the more signs and symptoms you have, the greater the likelihood you&apos;re having a heart attack. Some heart attacks strike suddenly, but many people have warning signs and symptoms hours, days or weeks in advance. The earliest warning may be recurrent chest pain (angina) that&apos;s triggered by exertion and relieved by rest. Angina is caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the heart. A heart attack differs from a condition in which your heart suddenly stops (sudden cardiac arrest, which occurs when an electrical disturbance disrupts your heart&apos;s pumping action and causes blood to stop flowing to the rest of your body). A heart attack can cause cardiac arrest, but it&apos;s not the only cause. When to see a doctor Act immediately. Some people wait too long because they don&apos;t recognize the important signs and symptoms. Take these steps: - Call for emergency medical help. If you suspect you&apos;re having a heart attack, don&apos;t hesitate. Immediately call 911 or your local emergency number. If you don&apos;t have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only if there are no other options. Because your condition can worsen, driving yourself puts you and others at risk. - Take nitroglycerin, if prescribed to you by a doctor. Take it as instructed while awaiting emergency help. - Take aspirin, if recommended. Taking aspirin during a heart attack could reduce heart damage by helping to keep your blood from clotting. Aspirin can interact with other medications, however, so don&apos;t take an aspirin unless your doctor or emergency medical personnel recommend it. Don&apos;t delay calling 911 to take an aspirin. Call for emergency help first. What to do if you see someone having a heart attack If you encounter someone who is unconscious, first call for emergency medical help. Then begin CPR to keep blood flowing. Push hard and fast on the person&apos;s chest in a fairly rapid rhythm - about 100 to 120 compressions a minute. It&apos;s not necessary to check the person&apos;s airway or deliver rescue breaths unless you&apos;ve been trained in CPR. A heart attack occurs when one or more of your coronary arteries become blocked. Over time, a coronary artery can narrow from the buildup of various substances, including cholesterol (atherosclerosis). This condition, known as coronary artery disease, causes most heart attacks. During a heart attack, one of these plaques can rupture and spill cholesterol and other substances into the bloodstream. A blood clot forms at the site of the rupture. If large enough, the clot can completely block the flow of blood through the coronary artery. Another cause of a heart attack is a spasm of a coronary artery that shuts down blood flow to part of the heart muscle. Use of tobacco and of illicit drugs, such as cocaine, can cause a life-threatening spasm. A heart attack can also occur due to a tear in the heart artery (spontaneous coronary artery dissection). Certain factors contribute to the unwanted buildup of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) that narrows arteries throughout your body. You can improve or eliminate many of these risk factors to reduce your chances of having a first or subsequent heart attack. Heart attack risk factors include: - Age. Men age 45 or older and women age 55 or older are more likely to have a heart attack than are younger men and women. - Tobacco. Smoking and long-term exposure to secondhand smoke increase the risk of a heart attack. - High blood pressure. Over time, high blood pressure can damage arteries that feed your heart by accelerating atherosclerosis. High blood pressure that occurs with obesity, smoking, high cholesterol or diabetes increases your risk even more. - High blood cholesterol or triglyceride levels. A high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (the &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol) is most likely to narrow arteries. A high level of triglycerides, a type of blood fat related to your diet, also ups your risk of heart attack. However, a high level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the &quot;good&quot; cholesterol) lowers your risk of heart attack. - Diabetes. Insulin, a hormone secreted by your pancreas, allows your body to use glucose, a form of sugar. Having diabetes - not producing enough insulin or not responding to insulin properly - causes your body&apos;s blood sugar levels to rise. Diabetes, especially uncontrolled, increases your risk of a heart attack. - Family history of heart attack. If your siblings, parents or grandparents have had early heart attacks (by age 55 for male relatives and by age 65 for female relatives), you may be at increased risk. - Lack of physical activity. An inactive lifestyle contributes to high blood cholesterol levels and obesity. People who get regular aerobic exercise have better cardiovascular fitness, which decreases their overall risk of heart attack. Exercise is also beneficial in lowering high blood pressure. - Obesity. Obesity is associated with high blood cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, high blood pressure and diabetes. Losing just 10 percent of your body weight can lower this risk, however. - Stress. You may respond to stress in ways that can increase your risk of a heart attack. - Illegal drug use. Using stimulant drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines, can trigger a spasm of your coronary arteries that can cause a heart attack. - A history of preeclampsia. This condition causes high blood pressure during pregnancy and increases the lifetime risk of heart disease. - A history of an autoimmune condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and other autoimmune conditions can increase your risk of having a heart attack. Complications are often related to the damage done to your heart during an attack. Damage can lead to: - Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). Electrical &quot;short circuits&quot; can develop, resulting in abnormal heart rhythms, some of which can be serious, even fatal. - Heart failure. An attack may damage so much heart tissue that the remaining heart muscle can&apos;t adequately pump blood out of your heart. Heart failure may be temporary, or it can be a chronic condition resulting from extensive and permanent damage to your heart. - Heart rupture. Areas of heart muscle weakened by a heart attack can rupture, leaving a hole in part of the heart. This rupture is often fatal. - Valve problems. Heart valves damaged during a heart attack may develop severe leakage problems. Ideally, your doctor should screen you during regular physical exams for risk factors that can lead to a heart attack. If you&apos;re in an emergency setting for symptoms of a heart attack, you&apos;ll be asked to describe your symptoms and have your blood pressure, pulse and temperature checked. You&apos;ll be hooked up to a heart monitor and will almost immediately have tests to see if you&apos;re having a heart attack. Tests will help check if your signs and symptoms, such as chest pain, indicate a heart attack or another condition. These tests include: - Electrocardiogram (ECG). This first test done to diagnose a heart attack records the electrical activity of your heart via electrodes attached to your skin. Impulses are recorded as waves displayed on a monitor or printed on paper. Because injured heart muscle doesn&apos;t conduct electrical impulses normally, the ECG may show that a heart attack has occurred or is in progress. - Blood tests. Certain heart enzymes slowly leak out into your blood if your heart has been damaged by a heart attack. Emergency room doctors will take samples of your blood to test for the presence of these enzymes. Additional tests If you&apos;ve had a heart attack or one is occurring, doctors will take immediate steps to treat your condition. You may also undergo these additional tests: - Chest X-ray. An X-ray image of your chest allows your doctor to check the size of your heart and its blood vessels and to look for fluid in your lungs. - Echocardiogram. During this test, sound waves directed at your heart from a wandlike device (transducer) held on your chest bounce off your heart and are processed electronically to provide video images of your heart. An echocardiogram can help identify whether an area of your heart has been damaged by a heart attack and isn&apos;t pumping normally or at peak capacity. - Coronary catheterization (angiogram). A liquid dye is injected into the arteries of your heart through a long, thin tube (catheter) that&apos;s fed through an artery, usually in your leg or groin, to the arteries in your heart. The dye makes the arteries visible on X-ray, revealing areas of blockage. - Exercise stress test. In the days or weeks after your heart attack, you may also undergo a stress test. Stress tests measure how your heart and blood vessels respond to exertion. You may walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bike while attached to an ECG machine. Or you may receive a drug intravenously that stimulates your heart similar to exercise. Your doctor may also order a nuclear stress test, which is similar to an exercise stress test, but uses an injected dye and special imaging techniques to produce detailed images of your heart while you&apos;re exercising. These tests can help determine your long-term treatment. - Cardiac computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These tests can be used to diagnose heart problems, including the extent of damage from heart attacks. In a cardiac CT scan, you lie on a table inside a doughnut-shaped machine. An X-ray tube inside the machine rotates around your body and collects images of your heart and chest. In a cardiac MRI, you lie on a table inside a long tubelike machine that produces a magnetic field. The magnetic field aligns atomic particles in some of your cells. When radio waves are broadcast toward these aligned particles, they produce signals that vary according to the type of tissue they are. The signals create images of your heart. Heart attack treatment at a hospital With each passing minute after a heart attack, more heart tissue loses oxygen and deteriorates or dies. The main way to prevent heart damage is to restore blood flow quickly. Medications Medications given to treat a heart attack include: - Aspirin. The 911 operator may instruct you to take aspirin, or emergency medical personnel may give you aspirin immediately. Aspirin reduces blood clotting, thus helping maintain blood flow through a narrowed artery. - Thrombolytics. These drugs, also called clotbusters, help dissolve a blood clot that&apos;s blocking blood flow to your heart. The earlier you receive a thrombolytic drug after a heart attack, the greater the chance you&apos;ll survive and with less heart damage. - Antiplatelet agents. Emergency room doctors may give you other drugs to help prevent new clots and keep existing clots from getting larger. These include medications, such as clopidogrel (Plavix) and others, called platelet aggregation inhibitors. - Other blood-thinning medications. You&apos;ll likely be given other medications, such as heparin, to make your blood less &quot;sticky&quot; and less likely to form clots. Heparin is given intravenously or by an injection under your skin. - Pain relievers. You may receive a pain reliever, such as morphine, to ease your discomfort. - Nitroglycerin. This medication, used to treat chest pain (angina), can help improve blood flow to the heart by widening (dilating) the blood vessels. - Beta blockers. These medications help relax your heart muscle, slow your heartbeat and decrease blood pressure, making your heart&apos;s job easier. Beta blockers can limit the amount of heart muscle damage and prevent future heart attacks. - ACE inhibitors. These drugs lower blood pressure and reduce stress on the heart. Surgical and other procedures In addition to medications, you may undergo one of the following procedures to treat your heart attack: - Coronary angioplasty and stenting. Doctors insert a long, thin tube (catheter) that&apos;s passed through an artery, usually in your leg or groin, to a blocked artery in your heart. If you&apos;ve had a heart attack, this procedure is often done immediately after a cardiac catheterization, a procedure used to locate blockages. This catheter is equipped with a special balloon that, once in position, is briefly inflated to open a blocked coronary artery. A metal mesh stent may be inserted into the artery to keep it open long term, restoring blood flow to the heart. Depending on your condition, your doctor may opt to place a stent coated with a slow-releasing medication to help keep your artery open. - Coronary artery bypass surgery. In some cases, doctors may perform emergency bypass surgery at the time of a heart attack. If possible, your doctor may suggest that you have bypass surgery after your heart has had time - about three to seven days - to recover from your heart attack. Bypass surgery involves sewing veins or arteries in place beyond a blocked or narrowed coronary artery, allowing blood flow to the heart to bypass the narrowed section. Once blood flow to your heart is restored and your condition is stable, you&apos;re likely to remain in the hospital for several days. Your lifestyle affects your heart health. The following steps can help you not only prevent but also recover from a heart attack: - Avoid smoke. The most important thing you can do to improve your heart&apos;s health is to not smoke. Also, avoid being around secondhand smoke. If you need to quit, ask your doctor for help. - Control your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. If one or both of these is high, your doctor can prescribe changes to your diet and medications. Ask your doctor how often you need to have your blood pressure and cholesterol levels monitored. - Get regular medical checkups. Some of the major risk factors for heart attack - high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes - cause no symptoms early on. Your doctor can perform tests to check for these conditions and help you manage them, if necessary. - Exercise regularly. Regular exercise helps improve heart muscle function after a heart attack and helps prevent a heart attack by helping you to control your weight, diabetes, cholesterol and blood pressure. Exercise needn&apos;t be vigorous. Walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week can improve your health. - Maintain a healthy weight. Excess weight strains your heart and can contribute to high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. - Eat a heart-healthy diet. Saturated fat, trans fats and cholesterol in your diet can narrow arteries to your heart, and too much salt can raise blood pressure. Eat a heart-healthy diet that includes lean proteins, such as fish and beans, plenty of fruits and vegetables and whole grains. - Manage diabetes. High blood sugar is damaging to your heart. Regular exercise, eating well and losing weight all help to keep blood sugar levels at more-desirable levels. Many people also need medication to manage their diabetes. - Control stress. Reduce stress in your day-to-day activities. Rethink workaholic habits and find healthy ways to minimize or deal with stressful events in your life. - If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and men older than age 65, and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Heart Attack (Signs and Symptoms): Not all heart attacks begin with the sudden, crushing chest pain that often is shown on TV or in the movies. In one study, for example, one-third of the patients who had heart attacks had no chest pain. These patients were more likely to be older, female, or diabetic. The symptoms of a heart attack can vary from person to person. Some people can have few symptoms and are surprised to learn they&apos;ve had a heart attack. If you&apos;ve already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. It is important for you to know the most common symptoms of a heart attack and also remember these facts: Heart attacks can start slowly and cause only mild pain or discomfort. Symptoms can be mild or more intense and sudden. Symptoms also may come and go over several hours. People who have high blood sugar (diabetes) may have no symptoms or very mild ones. The most common symptom, in both men and women, is chest pain or discomfort. Women are somewhat more likely to have shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, unusual tiredness (sometimes for days), and pain in the back, shoulders, and jaw. Some people don&apos;t have symptoms at all. Heart attacks that occur without any symptoms or with very mild symptoms are called silent heart attacks. Most Common Symptoms The most common warning symptoms of a heart attack for both men and women are: Chest pain or discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest. The discomfort usually lasts for more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion. The feeling can be mild or severe. Upper body discomfort. You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach (above the belly button). Shortness of breath. This may be your only symptom, or it may occur before or along with chest pain or discomfort. It can occur when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity. The symptoms of angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) can be similar to the symptoms of a heart attack. Angina is chest pain that occurs in people who have coronary heart disease, usually when they&apos;re active. Angina pain usually lasts for only a few minutes and goes away with rest. Chest pain or discomfort that doesn&apos;t go away or changes from its usual pattern (for example, occurs more often or while you&apos;re resting) can be a sign of a heart attack. All chest pain should be checked by a doctor. Other Common Signs and Symptoms Pay attention to these other possible symptoms of a heart attack: Breaking out in a cold sweat Feeling unusually tired for no reason, sometimes for days (especially if you are a woman) Nausea (feeling sick to the stomach) and vomiting Light-headedness or sudden dizziness Any sudden, new symptoms or a change in the pattern of symptoms you already have (for example, if your symptoms become stronger or last longer than usual) Not everyone having a heart attack has typical symptoms. If you&apos;ve already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. However, some people may have a pattern of symptoms that recur. The more signs and symptoms you have, the more likely it is that you&apos;re having a heart attack. Quick Action Can Save Your Life: Call 9–1–1  The signs and symptoms of a heart attack can develop suddenly. However, they also can develop slowly—sometimes within hours, days, or weeks of a heart attack. Any time you think you might be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack, don&apos;t ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help. Call 9–1–1 for emergency medical care, even if you are not sure whether you&apos;re having a heart attack. Here&apos;s why: Acting fast can save your life. An ambulance is the best and safest way to get to the hospital. Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel can check how you are doing and start life-saving medicines and other treatments right away. People who arrive by ambulance often receive faster treatment at the hospital.  The 9–1–1 operator or EMS technician can give you advice. You might be told to crush or chew an aspirin if you&apos;re not allergic, unless there is a medical reason for you not to take one. Aspirin taken during a heart attack can limit the damage to your heart and save your life. Every minute matters. Never delay calling 9–1–1 to take aspirin or do anything else you think might help.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Warning signs and symptoms of heart disease: Heart disease often develops over time. You may have early signs or symptoms long before you have serious heart problems. Or you may not realize you are developing heart disease. The warning signs of heart disease may not be obvious. Also, not every person has the same symptoms. Certain symptoms, such as chest pain, ankle swelling, and shortness of breath may be signals that something is wrong. Learning the warning signs can help you get treatment and help prevent a heart attack or stroke. Chest pain is discomfort or pain that you feel along the front of your body, between your neck and upper abdomen. There are many causes of chest pain that have nothing to do with your heart. But chest pain is still the most common symptom of poor blood flow to the heart or a heart attack. This type of chest pain is called angina. Chest pain can occur when the heart is not getting enough blood or oxygen. The amount and type of pain can vary from person to person. The intensity of the pain does not always relate to how severe the problem is. - Some people may feel a crushing pain, while others feel only mild discomfort. - Your chest may feel heavy or like someone is squeezing your heart. You may also feel a sharp, burning pain in your chest. - You may feel the pain under your breastbone (sternum), or in your neck, arms, stomach, jaw, or upper back. - Chest pain from angina often occurs with activity or emotion, and goes away with rest or a medicine called nitroglycerin. - Bad indigestion can also cause chest pain. Women, older adults, and people with diabetes may have little or no chest pain. They are more likely to have symptoms other than chest pain, such as: - Fatigue - Shortness of breath - General weakness - Change in skin color or greyish pallor (episodes of change in skin color associated with weakness) Other symptoms of a heart attack can include: - Extreme anxiety - Fainting or loss of consciousness - Lightheadedness or dizziness - Nausea or vomiting - Palpitations (feeling like your heart is beating too fast or irregularly) - Shortness of breath - Sweating, which may be very heavy When the heart can&apos;t pump blood as well as it should, blood backs up in the veins that go from the lungs to the heart. Fluid leaks into the lungs and causes shortness of breath. This is a symptom of heart failure. You may notice shortness of breath: - During activity - While you&apos;re resting - When you&apos;re lying flat on your back -- it may even wake you from sleep Coughing or wheezing that doesn&apos;t go away can be another sign that fluid is building up in your lungs. You may also cough up mucus that is pink or bloody. Swelling (edema) in your lower legs is another sign of a heart problem. When your heart doesn&apos;t work as well, blood flow slows and backs up in the veins in your legs. This causes fluid to build up in your tissues. You may also have swelling in your stomach or notice some weight gain. Narrowing of the blood vessels that bring blood to other parts of the body may mean you have a much higher risk for heart attack. It can occur when cholesterol and other fatty material (plaque) build up on the walls of your arteries. Poor blood supply to the legs may lead to: - Pain, achiness, fatigue, burning, or discomfort in the muscles of your feet, calves, or thighs. - Symptoms that often appear during walking or exercise, and go away after several minutes of rest. - Numbness in your legs or feet when you are at rest. Your legs may also feel cool to the touch, and the skin may look pale. A stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain stops. A stroke is sometimes called a &quot;brain attack.&quot; Symptoms of stroke can include difficulty moving the limbs on one side of your body, one side of the face drooping, difficulty with speaking or understanding language. Tiredness can have many causes. Often it simply means that you need more rest. But feeling run down can be a sign of a more serious problem. Fatigue may be a sign of heart trouble when: - You feel much more tired than normal. It&apos;s common for women to feel severely tired before or during a heart attack. - You feel so tired that you can&apos;t do your normal daily activities. - You have sudden, severe weakness. If your heart can&apos;t pump blood as well, it may beat faster to try to keep up. You may feel your heart racing or throbbing. A fast or uneven heartbeat can also be the sign of an arrhythmia. This is a problem with your heart rate or rhythm. If you have any signs of heart disease, call your health care provider right away. Don&apos;t wait to see if the symptoms go away or dismiss them as nothing. Call your local emergency number (such as 911) if: - You have chest pain or other symptoms of a heart attack - If you know you have angina and have chest pain that doesn&apos;t go away after 5 minutes of rest or after taking nitroglycerine - If you think you may be having a heart attack - If you become extremely short of breath - If you think you may have lost consciousness Updated by: Michael A.

				<AnswerText>Heart attack (Symptoms): A heart attack is a medical emergency. If you have symptoms of a heart attack, call 911 or your local emergency number right away. - DO NOT try to drive yourself to the hospital. - DO NOT WAIT. You are at greatest risk of sudden death in the early hours of a heart attack. Chest pain is the most common symptom of a heart attack. - You may feel the pain in only one part of your body OR - Pain may move from your chest to your arms, shoulder, neck, teeth, jaw, belly area, or back The pain can be severe or mild. It can feel like: - A tight band around the chest - Bad indigestion - Something heavy sitting on your chest - Squeezing or heavy pressure The pain most often lasts longer than 20 minutes. Rest and a medicine to relax the blood vessels (called nitroglycerin) may not completely relieve the pain of a heart attack. Symptoms may also go away and come back. Other symptoms of a heart attack can include: - Anxiety - Cough - Fainting - Lightheadedness, dizziness - Nausea and vomiting - Palpitations (feeling like your heart is beating too fast or irregularly) - Shortness of breath - Sweating, which may be very heavy Some people (the older adults, people with diabetes, and women) may have little or no chest pain.

				<AnswerText>Heart attack (Treatment): Heart attack treatment at a hospital With each passing minute after a heart attack, more heart tissue loses oxygen and deteriorates or dies. The main way to prevent heart damage is to restore blood flow quickly. Medications Medications given to treat a heart attack include: - Aspirin. The 911 operator may instruct you to take aspirin, or emergency medical personnel may give you aspirin immediately. Aspirin reduces blood clotting, thus helping maintain blood flow through a narrowed artery. - Thrombolytics. These drugs, also called clotbusters, help dissolve a blood clot that&apos;s blocking blood flow to your heart. The earlier you receive a thrombolytic drug after a heart attack, the greater the chance you&apos;ll survive and with less heart damage. - Antiplatelet agents. Emergency room doctors may give you other drugs to help prevent new clots and keep existing clots from getting larger. These include medications, such as clopidogrel (Plavix) and others, called platelet aggregation inhibitors. - Other blood-thinning medications. You&apos;ll likely be given other medications, such as heparin, to make your blood less &quot;sticky&quot; and less likely to form clots. Heparin is given intravenously or by an injection under your skin. - Pain relievers. You may receive a pain reliever, such as morphine, to ease your discomfort. - Nitroglycerin. This medication, used to treat chest pain (angina), can help improve blood flow to the heart by widening (dilating) the blood vessels. - Beta blockers. These medications help relax your heart muscle, slow your heartbeat and decrease blood pressure, making your heart&apos;s job easier. Beta blockers can limit the amount of heart muscle damage and prevent future heart attacks. - ACE inhibitors. These drugs lower blood pressure and reduce stress on the heart. Surgical and other procedures In addition to medications, you may undergo one of the following procedures to treat your heart attack: - Coronary angioplasty and stenting. Doctors insert a long, thin tube (catheter) that&apos;s passed through an artery, usually in your leg or groin, to a blocked artery in your heart. If you&apos;ve had a heart attack, this procedure is often done immediately after a cardiac catheterization, a procedure used to locate blockages. This catheter is equipped with a special balloon that, once in position, is briefly inflated to open a blocked coronary artery. A metal mesh stent may be inserted into the artery to keep it open long term, restoring blood flow to the heart. Depending on your condition, your doctor may opt to place a stent coated with a slow-releasing medication to help keep your artery open. - Coronary artery bypass surgery. In some cases, doctors may perform emergency bypass surgery at the time of a heart attack. If possible, your doctor may suggest that you have bypass surgery after your heart has had time - about three to seven days - to recover from your heart attack. Bypass surgery involves sewing veins or arteries in place beyond a blocked or narrowed coronary artery, allowing blood flow to the heart to bypass the narrowed section. Once blood flow to your heart is restored and your condition is stable, you&apos;re likely to remain in the hospital for several days.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What are the treatments for Heart Attack?: Heart attacks are a leading killer of both men and women in the United States. The good news is that excellent treatments are available for heart attacks. These treatments can save lives and prevent disabilities. Heart attack treatment works best when it&apos;s given right after symptoms occur. Act Fast The signs and symptoms of a heart attack can develop suddenly. However, they also can develop slowlysometimes within hours, days, or weeks of a heart attack. Know the warning signs of a heart attack so you can act fast to get treatment for yourself or someone else. The sooner you get emergency help, the less damage your heart will sustain. Call 911 for an ambulance right away if you think you or someone else may be having a heart attack. You also should call for help if your chest pain doesn&apos;t go away as it usually does when you take medicine prescribed for angina. Treatment May Start Right Away Treatment for a heart attack may begin in the ambulance or in the emergency department and continue in a special area of the hospital called a coronary care unit. Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. Restoring Blood Flow to the Heart The coronary care unit is specially equipped with monitors that continuously monitor your vital signs. These include - an EKG which detects any heart rhythm problems - a blood pressure monitor, and - pulse oximetry, which measures the amount of oxygen in the blood. an EKG which detects any heart rhythm problems a blood pressure monitor, and pulse oximetry, which measures the amount of oxygen in the blood. In the hospital, if you have had or are having a heart attack, doctors will work quickly to restore blood flow to your heart and continuously monitor your vital signs to detect and treat complications. Restoring blood flow to the heart can prevent or limit damage to the heart muscle and help prevent another heart attack. Doctors may use clot-busting drugs called thrombolytics and procedures such as angioplasty. - Clot-busters or thrombolytic drugs are used to dissolve blood clots that are blocking blood flow to the heart. When given soon after a heart attack begins, these drugs can limit or prevent permanent damage to the heart. To be most effective, these drugs must be given within one hour after the start of heart attack symptoms. - Angioplasty procedures are used to open blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. A stent, which is a tiny metal mesh tube, may be placed in the artery to help keep it open. Some stents are coated with medicines that help prevent the artery from becoming blocked again. - Coronary artery bypass surgery uses arteries or veins from other areas in your body to bypass your blocked coronary arteries.

Coronary artery bypass surgery uses arteries or veins from other areas in your body to bypass your blocked coronary arteries. Drug Treatments Many medications are used to treat heart attacks. They include beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, nitrates, anticoagulants, antiplatelet medications, and medications to relieve pain and anxiety. - Beta blockers slow your heart rate and reduce your heart&apos;s need for blood and oxygen. As a result, your heart beats with less force, and your blood pressure falls. Beta blockers are also used to relieve angina and prevent second heart attacks and correct an irregular heartbeat. - Angiotensin-converting enzyme or ACE inhibitors lower your blood pressure and reduce the strain on your heart. They are used in some patients after a heart attack to help prevent further weakening of the heart and increase the chances of survival. - Nitrates, such as nitroglycerin, relax blood vessels and relieve chest pain. Anticoagulants, such as heparin and warfarin, thin the blood and prevent clots from forming in your arteries. - &gt;Antiplatelet medications, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, stop platelets from clumping together to form clots. They are given to people who have had a heart attack, have angina, or have had an angioplasty. - Glycoprotein llb-llla inhibitors are potent antiplatelet medications given intravenously to prevent clots from forming in your arteries.

Doctors may also prescribe medications to relieve pain and anxiety, or to treat irregular heart rhythms which often occur during a heart attack. Echocardiogram and Stress Tests While you are still in the hospital or after you go home, your doctor may order other tests, such as an echocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses ultrasound to make an image of the heart which can be seen on a video monitor. It shows how well the heart is filling with blood and pumping it to the rest of the body. Your doctor may also order a stress test to see how well your heart works when it has a heavy workload. You run on a treadmill or pedal a bicycle or receive medicine through a vein in your arm to make your heart work harder. EKG and blood pressure readings are taken before, during, and after the test to see how your heart responds. Often, an echocardiogram or nuclear scan of the heart is performed before and after exercise or intravenous medication. The test is stopped if chest pain or a very sharp rise or fall in blood pressure occurs. Monitoring continues for 10 to 15 minutes after the test or until your heart rate returns to baseline.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Heart Attack (Signs and Symptoms): Not all heart attacks begin with the sudden, crushing chest pain that often is shown on TV or in the movies. In one study, for example, one-third of the patients who had heart attacks had no chest pain. These patients were more likely to be older, female, or diabetic. The symptoms of a heart attack can vary from person to person. Some people can have few symptoms and are surprised to learn they&apos;ve had a heart attack. If you&apos;ve already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. It is important for you to know the most common symptoms of a heart attack and also remember these facts: Heart attacks can start slowly and cause only mild pain or discomfort. Symptoms can be mild or more intense and sudden. Symptoms also may come and go over several hours. People who have high blood sugar (diabetes) may have no symptoms or very mild ones. The most common symptom, in both men and women, is chest pain or discomfort. Women are somewhat more likely to have shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, unusual tiredness (sometimes for days), and pain in the back, shoulders, and jaw. Some people don&apos;t have symptoms at all. Heart attacks that occur without any symptoms or with very mild symptoms are called silent heart attacks. Most Common Symptoms The most common warning symptoms of a heart attack for both men and women are: Chest pain or discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest. The discomfort usually lasts for more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion. The feeling can be mild or severe. Upper body discomfort. You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach (above the belly button). Shortness of breath. This may be your only symptom, or it may occur before or along with chest pain or discomfort. It can occur when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity. The symptoms of angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) can be similar to the symptoms of a heart attack. Angina is chest pain that occurs in people who have coronary heart disease, usually when they&apos;re active. Angina pain usually lasts for only a few minutes and goes away with rest. Chest pain or discomfort that doesn&apos;t go away or changes from its usual pattern (for example, occurs more often or while you&apos;re resting) can be a sign of a heart attack. All chest pain should be checked by a doctor. Other Common Signs and Symptoms Pay attention to these other possible symptoms of a heart attack: Breaking out in a cold sweat Feeling unusually tired for no reason, sometimes for days (especially if you are a woman) Nausea (feeling sick to the stomach) and vomiting Light-headedness or sudden dizziness Any sudden, new symptoms or a change in the pattern of symptoms you already have (for example, if your symptoms become stronger or last longer than usual) Not everyone having a heart attack has typical symptoms. If you&apos;ve already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. However, some people may have a pattern of symptoms that recur. The more signs and symptoms you have, the more likely it is that you&apos;re having a heart attack. Quick Action Can Save Your Life: Call 9–1–1  The signs and symptoms of a heart attack can develop suddenly. However, they also can develop slowly—sometimes within hours, days, or weeks of a heart attack. Any time you think you might be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack, don&apos;t ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help. Call 9–1–1 for emergency medical care, even if you are not sure whether you&apos;re having a heart attack. Here&apos;s why: Acting fast can save your life. An ambulance is the best and safest way to get to the hospital. Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel can check how you are doing and start life-saving medicines and other treatments right away. People who arrive by ambulance often receive faster treatment at the hospital.  The 9–1–1 operator or EMS technician can give you advice. You might be told to crush or chew an aspirin if you&apos;re not allergic, unless there is a medical reason for you not to take one. Aspirin taken during a heart attack can limit the damage to your heart and save your life. Every minute matters. Never delay calling 9–1–1 to take aspirin or do anything else you think might help.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Heart attack: A heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is blocked, most often by a build-up of fat, cholesterol and other substances, which form a plaque in the arteries that feed the heart (coronary arteries). The interrupted blood flow can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle. A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, can be fatal, but treatment has improved dramatically over the years. It&apos;s crucial to call 911 or emergency medical help if you think you might be having a heart attack. Common heart attack signs and symptoms include: - Pressure, tightness, pain, or a squeezing or aching sensation in your chest or arms that may spread to your neck, jaw or back - Nausea, indigestion, heartburn or abdominal pain - Shortness of breath - Cold sweat - Fatigue - Lightheadedness or sudden dizziness Heart attack symptoms vary Not all people who have heart attacks have the same symptoms or have the same severity of symptoms. Some people have mild pain; others have more severe pain. Some people have no symptoms, while for others, the first sign may be sudden cardiac arrest. However, the more signs and symptoms you have, the greater the likelihood you&apos;re having a heart attack. Some heart attacks strike suddenly, but many people have warning signs and symptoms hours, days or weeks in advance. The earliest warning may be recurrent chest pain (angina) that&apos;s triggered by exertion and relieved by rest. Angina is caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the heart. A heart attack differs from a condition in which your heart suddenly stops (sudden cardiac arrest, which occurs when an electrical disturbance disrupts your heart&apos;s pumping action and causes blood to stop flowing to the rest of your body). A heart attack can cause cardiac arrest, but it&apos;s not the only cause. When to see a doctor Act immediately. Some people wait too long because they don&apos;t recognize the important signs and symptoms. Take these steps: - Call for emergency medical help. If you suspect you&apos;re having a heart attack, don&apos;t hesitate. Immediately call 911 or your local emergency number. If you don&apos;t have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only if there are no other options. Because your condition can worsen, driving yourself puts you and others at risk. - Take nitroglycerin, if prescribed to you by a doctor. Take it as instructed while awaiting emergency help. - Take aspirin, if recommended. Taking aspirin during a heart attack could reduce heart damage by helping to keep your blood from clotting. Aspirin can interact with other medications, however, so don&apos;t take an aspirin unless your doctor or emergency medical personnel recommend it. Don&apos;t delay calling 911 to take an aspirin. Call for emergency help first. What to do if you see someone having a heart attack If you encounter someone who is unconscious, first call for emergency medical help. Then begin CPR to keep blood flowing. Push hard and fast on the person&apos;s chest in a fairly rapid rhythm - about 100 to 120 compressions a minute. It&apos;s not necessary to check the person&apos;s airway or deliver rescue breaths unless you&apos;ve been trained in CPR. A heart attack occurs when one or more of your coronary arteries become blocked. Over time, a coronary artery can narrow from the buildup of various substances, including cholesterol (atherosclerosis). This condition, known as coronary artery disease, causes most heart attacks. During a heart attack, one of these plaques can rupture and spill cholesterol and other substances into the bloodstream. A blood clot forms at the site of the rupture. If large enough, the clot can completely block the flow of blood through the coronary artery. Another cause of a heart attack is a spasm of a coronary artery that shuts down blood flow to part of the heart muscle. Use of tobacco and of illicit drugs, such as cocaine, can cause a life-threatening spasm. A heart attack can also occur due to a tear in the heart artery (spontaneous coronary artery dissection). Certain factors contribute to the unwanted buildup of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) that narrows arteries throughout your body. You can improve or eliminate many of these risk factors to reduce your chances of having a first or subsequent heart attack. Heart attack risk factors include: - Age. Men age 45 or older and women age 55 or older are more likely to have a heart attack than are younger men and women. - Tobacco. Smoking and long-term exposure to secondhand smoke increase the risk of a heart attack. - High blood pressure. Over time, high blood pressure can damage arteries that feed your heart by accelerating atherosclerosis. High blood pressure that occurs with obesity, smoking, high cholesterol or diabetes increases your risk even more. - High blood cholesterol or triglyceride levels. A high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (the &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol) is most likely to narrow arteries. A high level of triglycerides, a type of blood fat related to your diet, also ups your risk of heart attack. However, a high level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the &quot;good&quot; cholesterol) lowers your risk of heart attack. - Diabetes. Insulin, a hormone secreted by your pancreas, allows your body to use glucose, a form of sugar. Having diabetes - not producing enough insulin or not responding to insulin properly - causes your body&apos;s blood sugar levels to rise. Diabetes, especially uncontrolled, increases your risk of a heart attack. - Family history of heart attack. If your siblings, parents or grandparents have had early heart attacks (by age 55 for male relatives and by age 65 for female relatives), you may be at increased risk. - Lack of physical activity. An inactive lifestyle contributes to high blood cholesterol levels and obesity. People who get regular aerobic exercise have better cardiovascular fitness, which decreases their overall risk of heart attack. Exercise is also beneficial in lowering high blood pressure. - Obesity. Obesity is associated with high blood cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, high blood pressure and diabetes. Losing just 10 percent of your body weight can lower this risk, however. - Stress. You may respond to stress in ways that can increase your risk of a heart attack. - Illegal drug use. Using stimulant drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines, can trigger a spasm of your coronary arteries that can cause a heart attack. - A history of preeclampsia. This condition causes high blood pressure during pregnancy and increases the lifetime risk of heart disease. - A history of an autoimmune condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and other autoimmune conditions can increase your risk of having a heart attack. Complications are often related to the damage done to your heart during an attack. Damage can lead to: - Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). Electrical &quot;short circuits&quot; can develop, resulting in abnormal heart rhythms, some of which can be serious, even fatal. - Heart failure. An attack may damage so much heart tissue that the remaining heart muscle can&apos;t adequately pump blood out of your heart. Heart failure may be temporary, or it can be a chronic condition resulting from extensive and permanent damage to your heart. - Heart rupture. Areas of heart muscle weakened by a heart attack can rupture, leaving a hole in part of the heart. This rupture is often fatal. - Valve problems. Heart valves damaged during a heart attack may develop severe leakage problems. Ideally, your doctor should screen you during regular physical exams for risk factors that can lead to a heart attack. If you&apos;re in an emergency setting for symptoms of a heart attack, you&apos;ll be asked to describe your symptoms and have your blood pressure, pulse and temperature checked. You&apos;ll be hooked up to a heart monitor and will almost immediately have tests to see if you&apos;re having a heart attack. Tests will help check if your signs and symptoms, such as chest pain, indicate a heart attack or another condition. These tests include: - Electrocardiogram (ECG). This first test done to diagnose a heart attack records the electrical activity of your heart via electrodes attached to your skin. Impulses are recorded as waves displayed on a monitor or printed on paper. Because injured heart muscle doesn&apos;t conduct electrical impulses normally, the ECG may show that a heart attack has occurred or is in progress. - Blood tests. Certain heart enzymes slowly leak out into your blood if your heart has been damaged by a heart attack. Emergency room doctors will take samples of your blood to test for the presence of these enzymes. Additional tests If you&apos;ve had a heart attack or one is occurring, doctors will take immediate steps to treat your condition. You may also undergo these additional tests: - Chest X-ray. An X-ray image of your chest allows your doctor to check the size of your heart and its blood vessels and to look for fluid in your lungs. - Echocardiogram. During this test, sound waves directed at your heart from a wandlike device (transducer) held on your chest bounce off your heart and are processed electronically to provide video images of your heart. An echocardiogram can help identify whether an area of your heart has been damaged by a heart attack and isn&apos;t pumping normally or at peak capacity. - Coronary catheterization (angiogram). A liquid dye is injected into the arteries of your heart through a long, thin tube (catheter) that&apos;s fed through an artery, usually in your leg or groin, to the arteries in your heart. The dye makes the arteries visible on X-ray, revealing areas of blockage. - Exercise stress test. In the days or weeks after your heart attack, you may also undergo a stress test. Stress tests measure how your heart and blood vessels respond to exertion. You may walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bike while attached to an ECG machine. Or you may receive a drug intravenously that stimulates your heart similar to exercise. Your doctor may also order a nuclear stress test, which is similar to an exercise stress test, but uses an injected dye and special imaging techniques to produce detailed images of your heart while you&apos;re exercising. These tests can help determine your long-term treatment. - Cardiac computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These tests can be used to diagnose heart problems, including the extent of damage from heart attacks. In a cardiac CT scan, you lie on a table inside a doughnut-shaped machine. An X-ray tube inside the machine rotates around your body and collects images of your heart and chest. In a cardiac MRI, you lie on a table inside a long tubelike machine that produces a magnetic field. The magnetic field aligns atomic particles in some of your cells. When radio waves are broadcast toward these aligned particles, they produce signals that vary according to the type of tissue they are. The signals create images of your heart. Heart attack treatment at a hospital With each passing minute after a heart attack, more heart tissue loses oxygen and deteriorates or dies. The main way to prevent heart damage is to restore blood flow quickly. Medications Medications given to treat a heart attack include: - Aspirin. The 911 operator may instruct you to take aspirin, or emergency medical personnel may give you aspirin immediately. Aspirin reduces blood clotting, thus helping maintain blood flow through a narrowed artery. - Thrombolytics. These drugs, also called clotbusters, help dissolve a blood clot that&apos;s blocking blood flow to your heart. The earlier you receive a thrombolytic drug after a heart attack, the greater the chance you&apos;ll survive and with less heart damage. - Antiplatelet agents. Emergency room doctors may give you other drugs to help prevent new clots and keep existing clots from getting larger. These include medications, such as clopidogrel (Plavix) and others, called platelet aggregation inhibitors. - Other blood-thinning medications. You&apos;ll likely be given other medications, such as heparin, to make your blood less &quot;sticky&quot; and less likely to form clots. Heparin is given intravenously or by an injection under your skin. - Pain relievers. You may receive a pain reliever, such as morphine, to ease your discomfort. - Nitroglycerin. This medication, used to treat chest pain (angina), can help improve blood flow to the heart by widening (dilating) the blood vessels. - Beta blockers. These medications help relax your heart muscle, slow your heartbeat and decrease blood pressure, making your heart&apos;s job easier. Beta blockers can limit the amount of heart muscle damage and prevent future heart attacks. - ACE inhibitors. These drugs lower blood pressure and reduce stress on the heart. Surgical and other procedures In addition to medications, you may undergo one of the following procedures to treat your heart attack: - Coronary angioplasty and stenting. Doctors insert a long, thin tube (catheter) that&apos;s passed through an artery, usually in your leg or groin, to a blocked artery in your heart. If you&apos;ve had a heart attack, this procedure is often done immediately after a cardiac catheterization, a procedure used to locate blockages. This catheter is equipped with a special balloon that, once in position, is briefly inflated to open a blocked coronary artery. A metal mesh stent may be inserted into the artery to keep it open long term, restoring blood flow to the heart. Depending on your condition, your doctor may opt to place a stent coated with a slow-releasing medication to help keep your artery open. - Coronary artery bypass surgery. In some cases, doctors may perform emergency bypass surgery at the time of a heart attack. If possible, your doctor may suggest that you have bypass surgery after your heart has had time - about three to seven days - to recover from your heart attack. Bypass surgery involves sewing veins or arteries in place beyond a blocked or narrowed coronary artery, allowing blood flow to the heart to bypass the narrowed section. Once blood flow to your heart is restored and your condition is stable, you&apos;re likely to remain in the hospital for several days. Your lifestyle affects your heart health. The following steps can help you not only prevent but also recover from a heart attack: - Avoid smoke. The most important thing you can do to improve your heart&apos;s health is to not smoke. Also, avoid being around secondhand smoke. If you need to quit, ask your doctor for help. - Control your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. If one or both of these is high, your doctor can prescribe changes to your diet and medications. Ask your doctor how often you need to have your blood pressure and cholesterol levels monitored. - Get regular medical checkups. Some of the major risk factors for heart attack - high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes - cause no symptoms early on. Your doctor can perform tests to check for these conditions and help you manage them, if necessary. - Exercise regularly. Regular exercise helps improve heart muscle function after a heart attack and helps prevent a heart attack by helping you to control your weight, diabetes, cholesterol and blood pressure. Exercise needn&apos;t be vigorous. Walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week can improve your health. - Maintain a healthy weight. Excess weight strains your heart and can contribute to high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. - Eat a heart-healthy diet. Saturated fat, trans fats and cholesterol in your diet can narrow arteries to your heart, and too much salt can raise blood pressure. Eat a heart-healthy diet that includes lean proteins, such as fish and beans, plenty of fruits and vegetables and whole grains. - Manage diabetes. High blood sugar is damaging to your heart. Regular exercise, eating well and losing weight all help to keep blood sugar levels at more-desirable levels. Many people also need medication to manage their diabetes. - Control stress. Reduce stress in your day-to-day activities. Rethink workaholic habits and find healthy ways to minimize or deal with stressful events in your life. - If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and men older than age 65, and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger.</AnswerText>

If you&apos;re in an emergency setting for symptoms of a heart attack, you&apos;ll be asked to describe your symptoms and have your blood pressure, pulse and temperature checked. You&apos;ll be hooked up to a heart monitor and will almost immediately have tests to see if you&apos;re having a heart attack. Tests will help check if your signs and symptoms, such as chest pain, indicate a heart attack or another condition. These tests include: - Electrocardiogram (ECG). This first test done to diagnose a heart attack records the electrical activity of your heart via electrodes attached to your skin. Impulses are recorded as waves displayed on a monitor or printed on paper. Because injured heart muscle doesn&apos;t conduct electrical impulses normally, the ECG may show that a heart attack has occurred or is in progress. - Blood tests. Certain heart enzymes slowly leak out into your blood if your heart has been damaged by a heart attack. Emergency room doctors will take samples of your blood to test for the presence of these enzymes. Additional tests If you&apos;ve had a heart attack or one is occurring, doctors will take immediate steps to treat your condition. You may also undergo these additional tests: - Chest X-ray. An X-ray image of your chest allows your doctor to check the size of your heart and its blood vessels and to look for fluid in your lungs. - Echocardiogram. During this test, sound waves directed at your heart from a wandlike device (transducer) held on your chest bounce off your heart and are processed electronically to provide video images of your heart. An echocardiogram can help identify whether an area of your heart has been damaged by a heart attack and isn&apos;t pumping normally or at peak capacity. - Coronary catheterization (angiogram). A liquid dye is injected into the arteries of your heart through a long, thin tube (catheter) that&apos;s fed through an artery, usually in your leg or groin, to the arteries in your heart. The dye makes the arteries visible on X-ray, revealing areas of blockage. - Exercise stress test. In the days or weeks after your heart attack, you may also undergo a stress test. Stress tests measure how your heart and blood vessels respond to exertion. You may walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bike while attached to an ECG machine. Or you may receive a drug intravenously that stimulates your heart similar to exercise. Your doctor may also order a nuclear stress test, which is similar to an exercise stress test, but uses an injected dye and special imaging techniques to produce detailed images of your heart while you&apos;re exercising. These tests can help determine your long-term treatment. - Cardiac computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These tests can be used to diagnose heart problems, including the extent of damage from heart attacks. In a cardiac CT scan, you lie on a table inside a doughnut-shaped machine. An X-ray tube inside the machine rotates around your body and collects images of your heart and chest. In a cardiac MRI, you lie on a table inside a long tubelike machine that produces a magnetic field. The magnetic field aligns atomic particles in some of your cells. When radio waves are broadcast toward these aligned particles, they produce signals that vary according to the type of tissue they are. The signals create images of your heart.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>How to diagnose Heart Attack?: Your doctor will diagnose a heart attack based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and test results. Diagnostic Tests EKG (Electrocardiogram) An EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart&apos;s electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart. An EKG can show signs of heart damage due to coronary heart disease (CHD) and signs of a previous or current heart attack. Blood Tests During a heart attack, heart muscle cells die and release proteins into the bloodstream. Blood tests can measure the amount of these proteins in the bloodstream. Higher than normal levels of these proteins suggest a heart attack. Commonly used blood tests include troponin tests, CK or CKMB tests, and serum myoglobin tests. Blood tests often are repeated to check for changes over time. Coronary Angiography Coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show the insides of your coronary arteries. This test often is done during a heart attack to help find blockages in the coronary arteries. To get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun). A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream. Special x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through the coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through the heart and blood vessels. If your doctor finds a blockage, he or she may recommend a procedure calledpercutaneous (per-ku-TA-ne-us) coronary intervention (PCI), sometimes referred to ascoronary angioplasty(AN-jee-oh-plas-tee). This procedure can help restore blood flow through a blocked artery. Sometimes a small mesh tube called a stent is placed in the artery to help prevent blockages after the procedure.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>How to diagnose Heart Attack?: If You Have Symptoms, Call 9-1-1 Diagnosis and treatment of a heart attack can begin when emergency personnel arrive after you call 9-1-1. Do not put off calling 9-1-1 because you are not sure that you are having a heart attack. Call within 5 minutes of the start of symptoms. At the hospital emergency room, doctors will work fast to find out if you are having or have had a heart attack. They will consider your symptoms, medical and family history, and test results. Initial tests will be quickly followed by treatment if you are having a heart attack. Diagnostic Tests - an electrocardiogram - blood tests - nuclear heart scan - cardiac catheterization - and coronary angiography. an electrocardiogram blood tests nuclear heart scan cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography. The electrocardiogram, also known as ECG or EKG, is used to measure the rate and regularity of your heartbeat. Blood tests are also used in diagnosing a heart attack. When cells in the heart die, they release enzymes into the blood. They are called markers or biomarkers. Measuring the amount of these markers in the blood can show how much damage was done to your heart. Doctors often repeat these tests to check for changes. The nuclear heart scan uses radioactive tracers to outline the heart chambers and major blood vessels leading to and from the heart. A nuclear heart scan shows any damage to your heart muscle as well as how well blood flows to and from the heart. In cardiac catheterization, a thin, flexible tube is passed through an artery in your groin or arm to reach the coronary arteries. This test allows your doctor to - determine blood pressure and flow in the heart&apos;s chambers - collect blood samples from the heart, and - examine the arteries of the heart by x-ray. determine blood pressure and flow in the heart&apos;s chambers collect blood samples from the heart, and examine the arteries of the heart by x-ray. Coronary angiography is usually done with the cardiac catheterization. A dye that can be seen on an x-ray is injected through the catheter into the coronary arteries. It shows where there are blockages and how severe they are.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Heart Attack (Treatments): Early treatment for a heart attack can pr event or limit damage to the heart muscle. Acting fast, by calling 9–1–1 at the first symptoms of a heart attack, can save your life. Medical personnel can begin diagnosis and treatment even before you get to the hospital. Immediate Treatment Certain treatments usually are started right away if a heart attack is suspected, even before the diagnosis is confirmed. These include: Aspirin to prevent further blood clotting Nitroglycerin to reduce your heart’s workload and improve blood flow through the coronary arteries Oxygen therapy Treatment for chest pain Once the diagnosis of a heart attack is confirmed or strongly suspected, doctors start treatments promptly to try to restore blood flow through the blood vessels supplying the heart. The two main treatments are clot-busting medicines and percutaneous coronary intervention, also known as coronary angioplasty, a procedure used to open blocked coronary arteries. Clot-Busting Medicines Thrombolytic medicines, also called clot busters, are used to dissolve blood clots that are blocking the coronary arteries. To work best, these medicines must be given within several hours of the start of heart attack symptoms. Ideally, the medicine should be given as soon as possible. Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Percutaneous coronary intervention is a nonsurgical procedure that opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. A thin, flexible tube (catheter) with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel, usually in the groin (upper thigh), to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Once in place, the balloon located at the tip of the catheter is inflated to compress the plaque and related clot against the wall of the artery. This restores blood flow through the artery. During the procedure, the doctor may put a small mesh tube called a stent in the artery. The stent helps to keep the blood vessel open to prevent blockages in the artery in the months or years after the procedure. Other Treatments for Heart Attack Other treatments for heart attack include: Medicines Medical procedures Heart-healthy lifestyle changes Cardiac rehabilitation Medicines Your doctor may prescribe one or more of the following medicines. ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and reduce strain on your heart. They also help slow down further weakening of the heart muscle. Anticlotting medicines. Anticlotting medicines stop platelets from clumping together and forming unwanted blood clots. Examples of anticlotting medicines include aspirin and clopidogrel. Anticoagulants. Anticoagulants, or blood thinners, prevent blood clots from forming in your arteries. These medicines also keep existing clots from getting larger. Beta blockers. Beta blockers decrease your heart’s workload. These medicines also are used to relieve chest pain and discomfort and to help prevent another heart attack. Beta blockers also are used to treat arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats). Statin medicines. Statins control or lower your blood cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having another heart attack or stroke. You also may be given medicines to relieve pain and anxiety, and treat arrhythmias. Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Don’t change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to.  Medical Procedures Coronary artery bypass grafting also may be used to treat a heart attack. During coronary artery bypass grafting, a surgeon removes a healthy artery or vein from your body. The artery or vein is then connected, or grafted, to bypass the blocked section of the coronary artery. The grafted artery or vein bypasses (that is, goes around) the blocked portion of the coronary artery. This provides a new route for blood to flow to the heart muscle. Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes Treatment for a heart attack usually includes making heart-healthy lifestyle changes. Your doctor also may recommend: Heart-healthy eating Aiming for healthy weight Managing stress Physical activity Quitting smoking Taking these steps can lower your chances of having another heart attack. Cardiac Rehabilitation Your doctor may recommend cardiac rehabilitation (cardiac rehab) to help you recover from a heart attack and to help prevent another heart attack. Nearly everyone who has had a heart attack can benefit from rehab. Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that may help improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems. The cardiac rehab team may include doctors, nurses, exercise specialists, physical and occupational therapists, dietitians or nutritionists, and psychologists or other mental health specialists. Rehab has two parts: Education, counseling, and training. This part of rehab helps you understand your heart condition and find ways to reduce your risk for future heart problems. The rehab team will help you learn how to cope with the stress of adjusting to a new lifestyle and how to deal with your fears about the future. Exercise training. This part helps you learn how to exercise safely, strengthen your muscles, and improve your stamina. Your exercise plan will be based on your personal abilities, needs, and interests.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Heart attack: A heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is blocked, most often by a build-up of fat, cholesterol and other substances, which form a plaque in the arteries that feed the heart (coronary arteries). The interrupted blood flow can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle. A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, can be fatal, but treatment has improved dramatically over the years. It&apos;s crucial to call 911 or emergency medical help if you think you might be having a heart attack. Common heart attack signs and symptoms include: - Pressure, tightness, pain, or a squeezing or aching sensation in your chest or arms that may spread to your neck, jaw or back - Nausea, indigestion, heartburn or abdominal pain - Shortness of breath - Cold sweat - Fatigue - Lightheadedness or sudden dizziness Heart attack symptoms vary Not all people who have heart attacks have the same symptoms or have the same severity of symptoms. Some people have mild pain; others have more severe pain. Some people have no symptoms, while for others, the first sign may be sudden cardiac arrest. However, the more signs and symptoms you have, the greater the likelihood you&apos;re having a heart attack. Some heart attacks strike suddenly, but many people have warning signs and symptoms hours, days or weeks in advance. The earliest warning may be recurrent chest pain (angina) that&apos;s triggered by exertion and relieved by rest. Angina is caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the heart. A heart attack differs from a condition in which your heart suddenly stops (sudden cardiac arrest, which occurs when an electrical disturbance disrupts your heart&apos;s pumping action and causes blood to stop flowing to the rest of your body). A heart attack can cause cardiac arrest, but it&apos;s not the only cause. When to see a doctor Act immediately. Some people wait too long because they don&apos;t recognize the important signs and symptoms. Take these steps: - Call for emergency medical help. If you suspect you&apos;re having a heart attack, don&apos;t hesitate. Immediately call 911 or your local emergency number. If you don&apos;t have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only if there are no other options. Because your condition can worsen, driving yourself puts you and others at risk. - Take nitroglycerin, if prescribed to you by a doctor. Take it as instructed while awaiting emergency help. - Take aspirin, if recommended. Taking aspirin during a heart attack could reduce heart damage by helping to keep your blood from clotting. Aspirin can interact with other medications, however, so don&apos;t take an aspirin unless your doctor or emergency medical personnel recommend it. Don&apos;t delay calling 911 to take an aspirin. Call for emergency help first. What to do if you see someone having a heart attack If you encounter someone who is unconscious, first call for emergency medical help. Then begin CPR to keep blood flowing. Push hard and fast on the person&apos;s chest in a fairly rapid rhythm - about 100 to 120 compressions a minute. It&apos;s not necessary to check the person&apos;s airway or deliver rescue breaths unless you&apos;ve been trained in CPR. A heart attack occurs when one or more of your coronary arteries become blocked. Over time, a coronary artery can narrow from the buildup of various substances, including cholesterol (atherosclerosis). This condition, known as coronary artery disease, causes most heart attacks. During a heart attack, one of these plaques can rupture and spill cholesterol and other substances into the bloodstream. A blood clot forms at the site of the rupture. If large enough, the clot can completely block the flow of blood through the coronary artery. Another cause of a heart attack is a spasm of a coronary artery that shuts down blood flow to part of the heart muscle. Use of tobacco and of illicit drugs, such as cocaine, can cause a life-threatening spasm. A heart attack can also occur due to a tear in the heart artery (spontaneous coronary artery dissection). Certain factors contribute to the unwanted buildup of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) that narrows arteries throughout your body. You can improve or eliminate many of these risk factors to reduce your chances of having a first or subsequent heart attack. Heart attack risk factors include: - Age. Men age 45 or older and women age 55 or older are more likely to have a heart attack than are younger men and women. - Tobacco. Smoking and long-term exposure to secondhand smoke increase the risk of a heart attack. - High blood pressure. Over time, high blood pressure can damage arteries that feed your heart by accelerating atherosclerosis. High blood pressure that occurs with obesity, smoking, high cholesterol or diabetes increases your risk even more. - High blood cholesterol or triglyceride levels. A high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (the &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol) is most likely to narrow arteries. A high level of triglycerides, a type of blood fat related to your diet, also ups your risk of heart attack. However, a high level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the &quot;good&quot; cholesterol) lowers your risk of heart attack. - Diabetes. Insulin, a hormone secreted by your pancreas, allows your body to use glucose, a form of sugar. Having diabetes - not producing enough insulin or not responding to insulin properly - causes your body&apos;s blood sugar levels to rise. Diabetes, especially uncontrolled, increases your risk of a heart attack. - Family history of heart attack. If your siblings, parents or grandparents have had early heart attacks (by age 55 for male relatives and by age 65 for female relatives), you may be at increased risk. - Lack of physical activity. An inactive lifestyle contributes to high blood cholesterol levels and obesity. People who get regular aerobic exercise have better cardiovascular fitness, which decreases their overall risk of heart attack. Exercise is also beneficial in lowering high blood pressure. - Obesity. Obesity is associated with high blood cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, high blood pressure and diabetes. Losing just 10 percent of your body weight can lower this risk, however. - Stress. You may respond to stress in ways that can increase your risk of a heart attack. - Illegal drug use. Using stimulant drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines, can trigger a spasm of your coronary arteries that can cause a heart attack. - A history of preeclampsia. This condition causes high blood pressure during pregnancy and increases the lifetime risk of heart disease. - A history of an autoimmune condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and other autoimmune conditions can increase your risk of having a heart attack. Complications are often related to the damage done to your heart during an attack. Damage can lead to: - Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). Electrical &quot;short circuits&quot; can develop, resulting in abnormal heart rhythms, some of which can be serious, even fatal. - Heart failure. An attack may damage so much heart tissue that the remaining heart muscle can&apos;t adequately pump blood out of your heart. Heart failure may be temporary, or it can be a chronic condition resulting from extensive and permanent damage to your heart. - Heart rupture. Areas of heart muscle weakened by a heart attack can rupture, leaving a hole in part of the heart. This rupture is often fatal. - Valve problems. Heart valves damaged during a heart attack may develop severe leakage problems. Ideally, your doctor should screen you during regular physical exams for risk factors that can lead to a heart attack. If you&apos;re in an emergency setting for symptoms of a heart attack, you&apos;ll be asked to describe your symptoms and have your blood pressure, pulse and temperature checked. You&apos;ll be hooked up to a heart monitor and will almost immediately have tests to see if you&apos;re having a heart attack.

An X-ray tube inside the machine rotates around your body and collects images of your heart and chest.

When radio waves are broadcast toward these aligned particles, they produce signals that vary according to the type of tissue they are. The signals create images of your heart. Heart attack treatment at a hospital With each passing minute after a heart attack, more heart tissue loses oxygen and deteriorates or dies. The main way to prevent heart damage is to restore blood flow quickly. Medications Medications given to treat a heart attack include: - Aspirin. The 911 operator may instruct you to take aspirin, or emergency medical personnel may give you aspirin immediately. Aspirin reduces blood clotting, thus helping maintain blood flow through a narrowed artery. - Thrombolytics. These drugs, also called clotbusters, help dissolve a blood clot that&apos;s blocking blood flow to your heart. The earlier you receive a thrombolytic drug after a heart attack, the greater the chance you&apos;ll survive and with less heart damage. - Antiplatelet agents. Emergency room doctors may give you other drugs to help prevent new clots and keep existing clots from getting larger. These include medications, such as clopidogrel (Plavix) and others, called platelet aggregation inhibitors. - Other blood-thinning medications. You&apos;ll likely be given other medications, such as heparin, to make your blood less &quot;sticky&quot; and less likely to form clots. Heparin is given intravenously or by an injection under your skin. - Pain relievers. You may receive a pain reliever, such as morphine, to ease your discomfort. - Nitroglycerin. This medication, used to treat chest pain (angina), can help improve blood flow to the heart by widening (dilating) the blood vessels. - Beta blockers. These medications help relax your heart muscle, slow your heartbeat and decrease blood pressure, making your heart&apos;s job easier. Beta blockers can limit the amount of heart muscle damage and prevent future heart attacks. - ACE inhibitors. These drugs lower blood pressure and reduce stress on the heart. Surgical and other procedures In addition to medications, you may undergo one of the following procedures to treat your heart attack: - Coronary angioplasty and stenting. Doctors insert a long, thin tube (catheter) that&apos;s passed through an artery, usually in your leg or groin, to a blocked artery in your heart. If you&apos;ve had a heart attack, this procedure is often done immediately after a cardiac catheterization, a procedure used to locate blockages. This catheter is equipped with a special balloon that, once in position, is briefly inflated to open a blocked coronary artery. A metal mesh stent may be inserted into the artery to keep it open long term, restoring blood flow to the heart. Depending on your condition, your doctor may opt to place a stent coated with a slow-releasing medication to help keep your artery open. - Coronary artery bypass surgery. In some cases, doctors may perform emergency bypass surgery at the time of a heart attack. If possible, your doctor may suggest that you have bypass surgery after your heart has had time - about three to seven days - to recover from your heart attack. Bypass surgery involves sewing veins or arteries in place beyond a blocked or narrowed coronary artery, allowing blood flow to the heart to bypass the narrowed section. Once blood flow to your heart is restored and your condition is stable, you&apos;re likely to remain in the hospital for several days. Your lifestyle affects your heart health. The following steps can help you not only prevent but also recover from a heart attack: - Avoid smoke. The most important thing you can do to improve your heart&apos;s health is to not smoke. Also, avoid being around secondhand smoke. If you need to quit, ask your doctor for help. - Control your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. If one or both of these is high, your doctor can prescribe changes to your diet and medications. Ask your doctor how often you need to have your blood pressure and cholesterol levels monitored. - Get regular medical checkups. Some of the major risk factors for heart attack - high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes - cause no symptoms early on. Your doctor can perform tests to check for these conditions and help you manage them, if necessary. - Exercise regularly. Regular exercise helps improve heart muscle function after a heart attack and helps prevent a heart attack by helping you to control your weight, diabetes, cholesterol and blood pressure. Exercise needn&apos;t be vigorous. Walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week can improve your health. - Maintain a healthy weight. Excess weight strains your heart and can contribute to high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. - Eat a heart-healthy diet. Saturated fat, trans fats and cholesterol in your diet can narrow arteries to your heart, and too much salt can raise blood pressure. Eat a heart-healthy diet that includes lean proteins, such as fish and beans, plenty of fruits and vegetables and whole grains. - Manage diabetes. High blood sugar is damaging to your heart. Regular exercise, eating well and losing weight all help to keep blood sugar levels at more-desirable levels. Many people also need medication to manage their diabetes. - Control stress. Reduce stress in your day-to-day activities. Rethink workaholic habits and find healthy ways to minimize or deal with stressful events in your life. - If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and men older than age 65, and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Heart Attack (Signs and Symptoms): Not all heart attacks begin with the sudden, crushing chest pain that often is shown on TV or in the movies. In one study, for example, one-third of the patients who had heart attacks had no chest pain. These patients were more likely to be older, female, or diabetic. The symptoms of a heart attack can vary from person to person. Some people can have few symptoms and are surprised to learn they&apos;ve had a heart attack. If you&apos;ve already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. It is important for you to know the most common symptoms of a heart attack and also remember these facts: Heart attacks can start slowly and cause only mild pain or discomfort. Symptoms can be mild or more intense and sudden. Symptoms also may come and go over several hours. People who have high blood sugar (diabetes) may have no symptoms or very mild ones. The most common symptom, in both men and women, is chest pain or discomfort. Women are somewhat more likely to have shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, unusual tiredness (sometimes for days), and pain in the back, shoulders, and jaw. Some people don&apos;t have symptoms at all. Heart attacks that occur without any symptoms or with very mild symptoms are called silent heart attacks. Most Common Symptoms The most common warning symptoms of a heart attack for both men and women are: Chest pain or discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest. The discomfort usually lasts for more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion. The feeling can be mild or severe. Upper body discomfort. You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach (above the belly button). Shortness of breath. This may be your only symptom, or it may occur before or along with chest pain or discomfort. It can occur when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity. The symptoms of angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) can be similar to the symptoms of a heart attack. Angina is chest pain that occurs in people who have coronary heart disease, usually when they&apos;re active. Angina pain usually lasts for only a few minutes and goes away with rest. Chest pain or discomfort that doesn&apos;t go away or changes from its usual pattern (for example, occurs more often or while you&apos;re resting) can be a sign of a heart attack. All chest pain should be checked by a doctor. Other Common Signs and Symptoms Pay attention to these other possible symptoms of a heart attack: Breaking out in a cold sweat Feeling unusually tired for no reason, sometimes for days (especially if you are a woman) Nausea (feeling sick to the stomach) and vomiting Light-headedness or sudden dizziness Any sudden, new symptoms or a change in the pattern of symptoms you already have (for example, if your symptoms become stronger or last longer than usual) Not everyone having a heart attack has typical symptoms. If you&apos;ve already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. However, some people may have a pattern of symptoms that recur. The more signs and symptoms you have, the more likely it is that you&apos;re having a heart attack. Quick Action Can Save Your Life: Call 9–1–1  The signs and symptoms of a heart attack can develop suddenly. However, they also can develop slowly—sometimes within hours, days, or weeks of a heart attack. Any time you think you might be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack, don&apos;t ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help. Call 9–1–1 for emergency medical care, even if you are not sure whether you&apos;re having a heart attack. Here&apos;s why: Acting fast can save your life. An ambulance is the best and safest way to get to the hospital. Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel can check how you are doing and start life-saving medicines and other treatments right away. People who arrive by ambulance often receive faster treatment at the hospital.  The 9–1–1 operator or EMS technician can give you advice. You might be told to crush or chew an aspirin if you&apos;re not allergic, unless there is a medical reason for you not to take one. Aspirin taken during a heart attack can limit the damage to your heart and save your life. Every minute matters. Never delay calling 9–1–1 to take aspirin or do anything else you think might help.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Heart Attack (Prevention): Lowering your risk factors for coronary heart disease can help you prevent a heart attack. Even if you already have coronary heart disease, you still can take steps to lower your risk for a heart attack. These steps involve making heart-healthy lifestyle changes and getting ongoing medical care for related conditions that make heart attack more likely. Talk to your doctor about whether you may benefit from aspirin primary prevention, or using aspirin to help prevent your first heart attack. Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes A heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent a heart attack and includes heart-healthy eating, being physically active, quitting smoking, managing stress, and managing your weight. Ongoing Care Treat Related Conditions Treating conditions that make a heart attack more likely also can help lower your risk for a heart attack. These conditions may include: Diabetes (high blood sugar). If you have diabetes, try to control your blood sugar level through diet and physical activity (as your doctor recommends). If needed, take medicine as prescribed. High blood cholesterol. Your doctor may prescribe a statin medicine to lower your cholesterol if diet and exercise aren’t enough. High blood pressure. Your doctor may prescribe medicine to keep your blood pressure under control. Chronic kidney disease. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to control your high blood pressure or high blood sugar levels. Peripheral artery disease. Your doctor may recommend surgery or procedures to unblock the affected arteries. Have an Emergency Action Plan Make sure that you have an emergency action plan in case you or someone in your family has a heart attack. This is very important if you’re at high risk for, or have already had, a heart attack. Write down a list of medicines you are taking, medicines you are allergic to, your health care provider’s phone numbers (both during and after office hours), and contact information for a friend or relative. Keep the list in a handy place (for example, fill out this wallet card) to share in a medical emergency. Talk with your doctor about the signs and symptoms of a heart attack, when you should call 9–1–1, and steps you can take while waiting for medical help to arrive.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Dementia (WHAT IS DEMENTIA?): Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning-thinking, remembering, and reasoning-and behavioral abilities to such an extent that it interferes with a person&apos;s daily life and activities. Dementia ranges in severity from the mildest stage, when it is just beginning to affect a person&apos;s functioning, to the most severe stage, when the person must depend completely on others for basic activities of living.Signs and symptoms of dementia result when once-healthy neurons (nerve cells) in the brain stop working, lose connections with other brain cells, and die. While everyone loses some neurons as they age, people with dementia experience far greater loss.While dementia is more common as people grow older (up to half of all people age 85 or older may have some form of dementia), it is not a normal part of aging. Many people live into their 90s and beyond without any signs of dementia. One type of dementia, frontotemporal disorders, is more common in middle-aged than older adults.Memory loss, though common, is not the only sign of dementia. For a person to have dementia, he or she must have:- Two or more core mental functions that are impaired. These functions include memory, language skills, visual perception, and the ability to focus and pay attention. These also include cognitive skills such as the ability to reason and solve problems. - A loss of brain function severe enough that a person cannot do normal, everyday tasksIn addition, some people with dementia cannot control their emotions. Their personalities may change. They can have delusions, which are strong beliefs without proof, such as the idea that someone is stealing from them. They also may hallucinate, seeing or otherwise experiencing things that are not real.The causes of dementia can vary, depending on the types of brain changes that may be taking place. Other dementias include Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal disorders, and vascular dementia. It is common for people to have mixed dementia-a combination of two or more disorders, at least one of which is dementia. For example, some people have both Alzheimer&apos;s disease and vascular dementia.Learn more about dementia from MedlinePlus.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What is Dementia?: Dementia is not a specific disease. It is a descriptive term for a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of disorders that affect the brain. People with dementia have significantly impaired intellectual functioning that interferes with normal activities and relationships. They also lose their ability to solve problems and maintain emotional control, and they may experience personality changes and behavioral problems, such as agitation, delusions, and hallucinations. While memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, memory loss by itself does not mean that a person has dementia. Doctors diagnose dementia only if two or more brain functions - such as memory and language skills -- are significantly impaired without loss of consciousness. Some of the diseases that can cause symptoms of dementia are Alzheimers disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntingtons disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Doctors have identified other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms including reactions to medications, metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, infections, poisoning, brain tumors, anoxia or hypoxia (conditions in which the brains oxygen supply is either reduced or cut off entirely), and heart and lung problems. Although it is common in very elderly individuals, dementia is not a normal part of the aging process.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Dementia: Dementia isn&apos;t a specific disease. Instead, dementia describes a group of symptoms affecting memory, thinking and social abilities severely enough to interfere with daily functioning. Though dementia generally involves memory loss, memory loss has different causes. So memory loss alone doesn&apos;t mean you have dementia. Alzheimer&apos;s disease is the most common cause of a progressive dementia in older adults, but there are a number of causes of dementia. Depending on the cause, some dementia symptoms can be reversed. Dementia care at Mayo Clinic Dementia symptoms vary depending on the cause, but common signs and symptoms include: Cognitive changes - Memory loss, which is usually noticed by a spouse or someone else - Difficulty communicating or finding words - Difficulty reasoning or problem-solving - Difficulty handling complex tasks - Difficulty with planning and organizing - Difficulty with coordination and motor functions - Confusion and disorientation Psychological changes - Personality changes - Depression - Anxiety - Inappropriate behavior - Paranoia - Agitation - Hallucinations When to see a doctor See a doctor if you or a loved one has memory problems or other dementia symptoms. Some treatable medical conditions can cause dementia symptoms, so it&apos;s important to determine the underlying cause. Dementia involves damage of nerve cells in the brain, which can occur in several areas of the brain. Dementia affects people differently, depending on the area of the brain affected. Dementias are often grouped by what they have in common, such as the part of the brain that&apos;s affected or whether they worsen over time (progressive dementias). Some dementias, such as those caused by a reaction to medications or vitamin deficiencies, might improve with treatment. Progressive dementias Types of dementias that progress and aren&apos;t reversible include: - Alzheimer&apos;s disease. In people age 65 and older, Alzheimer&apos;s disease is the most common cause of dementia. Although the cause of Alzheimer&apos;s disease isn&apos;t known, plaques and tangles are often found in the brains of people with Alzheimer&apos;s. Plaques are clumps of a protein called beta-amyloid, and tangles are fibrous tangles made up of tau protein. Certain genetic factors might make it more likely that people will develop Alzheimer&apos;s. - Vascular dementia. This second most common type of dementia occurs as a result of damage to the vessels that supply blood to your brain. Blood vessel problems can be caused by stroke or other blood vessel conditions. - Lewy body dementia. Lewy bodies are abnormal clumps of protein that have been found in the brains of people with Lewy body dementia, Alzheimer&apos;s disease and Parkinson&apos;s disease. This is one of the more common types of progressive dementia. - Frontotemporal dementia. This is a group of diseases characterized by the breakdown (degeneration) of nerve cells in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, the areas generally associated with personality, behavior and language. As with other dementias, the cause isn&apos;t known. - Mixed dementia. Autopsy studies of the brains of people 80 and older who had dementia indicate that many had a combination of Alzheimer&apos;s disease, vascular dementia and Lewy body dementia. Studies are ongoing to determine how having mixed dementia affects symptoms and treatments. Other disorders linked to dementia - Huntington&apos;s disease. Caused by a genetic mutation, this disease causes certain nerve cells in your brain and spinal cord to waste away. Signs and symptoms, including a severe decline in thinking (cognitive) skills usually appear around age 30 or 40. - Traumatic brain injury. This condition is caused by repetitive head trauma, such as experienced by boxers, football players or soldiers. Depending on the part of the brain that&apos;s injured, this condition can cause dementia signs and symptoms, such as depression, explosiveness, memory loss, uncoordinated movement and impaired speech, as well as slow movement, tremors and rigidity (parkinsonism). Symptoms might not appear until years after the trauma. - Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This rare brain disorder usually occurs in people without known risk factors. This condition might be due to an abnormal form of a protein. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease can be inherited or caused by exposure to diseased brain or nervous system tissue. Signs and symptoms of this fatal condition usually appear around age 60. - Parkinson&apos;s disease. Many people with Parkinson&apos;s disease eventually develop dementia symptoms (Parkinson&apos;s disease dementia). Dementia-like conditions that can be reversed Some causes of dementia or dementia-like symptoms can be reversed with treatment. They include: - Infections and immune disorders. Dementia-like symptoms can result from fever or other side effects of your body&apos;s attempt to fight off an infection. Conditions such as multiple sclerosis that result from the body&apos;s immune system attacking nerve cells also can cause dementia. - Metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities. People with thyroid problems, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), too little or too much sodium or calcium, or an impaired ability to absorb vitamin B-12 can develop dementia-like symptoms or other personality changes. - Nutritional deficiencies. Not drinking enough liquids (dehydration); not getting enough thiamin (vitamin B-1), which is common in people with chronic alcoholism; and not getting enough vitamins B-6 and B-12 in your diet can cause dementia-like symptoms. - Reactions to medications. A reaction to a medication or an interaction of several medications can cause dementia-like symptoms. - Subdural hematomas. Bleeding between the surface of the brain and the covering over the brain, which is common in the elderly after a fall, can cause symptoms similar to dementia. - Poisoning. Exposure to heavy metals, such as lead, and other poisons, such as pesticides, as well as alcohol abuse or recreational drug use can lead to symptoms of dementia. Symptoms might resolve with treatment. - Brain tumors. Rarely, dementia can result from damage caused by a brain tumor. - Anoxia. This condition, also called hypoxia, occurs when organ tissues aren&apos;t getting enough oxygen. Anoxia can occur due to severe asthma, heart attack, carbon monoxide poisoning or other causes. - Normal-pressure hydrocephalus. This condition, which is caused by enlarged ventricles in the brain, can cause walking problems, urinary difficulty and memory loss. Many factors can eventually lead to dementia. Some factors, such as age, can&apos;t be changed. Others can be addressed to reduce your risk. Risk factors that can&apos;t be changed - Age. The risk rises as you age, especially after age 65. However, dementia isn&apos;t a normal part of aging, and dementia can occur in younger people. - Family history. Having a family history of dementia puts you at greater risk of developing the condition. However, many people with a family history never develop symptoms, and many people without a family history do. Tests to determine whether you have certain genetic mutations are available. - Down syndrome. By middle age, many people with Down syndrome develop early-onset Alzheimer&apos;s disease. - Mild cognitive impairment. This involves difficulties with memory but without loss of daily function. It puts people at higher risk of dementia. Risk factors you can change You might be able to control the following risk factors of dementia. - Heavy alcohol use. If you drink large amounts of alcohol, you might have a higher risk of dementia. Some studies, however, have shown that moderate amounts of alcohol might have a protective effect. - Cardiovascular risk factors. These include high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol, buildup of fats in your artery walls (atherosclerosis) and obesity. - Depression. Although not yet well-understood, late-life depression might indicate the development of dementia. - Diabetes. If you have diabetes, you might have an increased risk of dementia, especially if it&apos;s poorly controlled. - Smoking. Smoking might increase your risk of developing dementia and blood vessel (vascular) diseases. - Sleep apnea. People who snore and have episodes where they frequently stop breathing while asleep may have reversible memory loss. Dementia can affect many body systems and, therefore, the ability to function. Dementia can lead to: - Inadequate nutrition. Many people with dementia eventually reduce or stop their intake of nutrients. Ultimately, they may be unable to chew and swallow. - Pneumonia. Difficulty swallowing increases the risk of choking or aspirating food into the lungs, which can block breathing and cause pneumonia. - Inability to perform self-care tasks. As dementia progresses, it can interfere with bathing, dressing, brushing hair or teeth, using the toilet independently and taking medications accurately. - Personal safety challenges. Some day-to-day situations can present safety issues for people with dementia, including driving, cooking and walking alone. - Death. Late-stage dementia results in coma and death, often from infection. Diagnosing dementia and determining what type it is can be challenging. A diagnosis of dementia requires that at least two core mental functions be impaired enough to interfere with daily living. They are memory, language skills, ability to focus and pay attention, ability to reason and problem-solve, and visual perception. Your doctor will review your medical history and symptoms and conduct a physical examination. He or she will likely ask someone close to you about your symptoms, as well. No single test can diagnose dementia, so doctors are likely to run a number of tests that can help pinpoint the problem. Cognitive and neuropsychological tests Doctors will evaluate your thinking (cognitive) function. A number of tests measure thinking skills such as memory, orientation, reasoning and judgment, language skills, and attention. Neurological evaluation Doctors evaluate your memory, language, visual perception, attention, problem-solving, movement, senses, balance, reflexes and other areas. Brain scans - CT or MRI. These scans can check for evidence of stroke or bleeding or tumor or hydrocephalus. - PET scans. These can show patterns of brain activity and if the amyloid protein, a hallmark of Alzheimer&apos;s disease, has been deposited in the brain. Laboratory tests Simple blood tests can detect physical problems that can affect brain function, such as vitamin B-12 deficiency or an underactive thyroid gland. Sometimes the spinal fluid is examined for infection, inflammation or markers of some degenerative diseases. Psychiatric evaluation A mental health professional can determine whether depression or another mental health condition is contributing to your symptoms. Most types of dementia can&apos;t be cured, but there are ways to manage your symptoms. Medications The following are used to temporarily improve dementia symptoms. - Cholinesterase inhibitors. These medications - including donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon) and galantamine (Razadyne) - work by boosting levels of a chemical messenger involved in memory and judgment. Although primarily used to treat Alzheimer&apos;s disease, these medications might also be prescribed for other dementias, including vascular dementia, Parkinson&apos;s disease dementia and Lewy body dementia. Side effects can include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. - Memantine. Memantine (Namenda) works by regulating the activity of glutamate, another chemical messenger involved in brain functions, such as learning and memory. In some cases, memantine is prescribed with a cholinesterase inhibitor. A common side effect of memantine is dizziness. - Other medications. Your doctor might prescribe medications to treat other symptoms or conditions, such as depression, sleep disturbances or agitation. Therapies Several dementia symptoms and behavior problems might be treated initially using nondrug approaches, such as: - Occupational therapy. An occupational therapist can show you how to make your home safer and teach coping behaviors. The purpose is to prevent accidents, such as falls; manage behavior; and prepare you for the dementia progression. - Modifying the environment. Reducing clutter and noise can make it easier for someone with dementia to focus and function. You might need to hide objects that can threaten safety, such as knives and car keys. Monitoring systems can alert you if the person with dementia wanders. - Modifying tasks. Break tasks into easier steps and focus on success, not failure. Structure and routine also help reduce confusion in people with dementia. Dementia symptoms and behavior problems will progress over time. Caregivers might try the following suggestions: - Enhance communication. When talking with your loved one, maintain eye contact. Speak slowly in simple sentences, and don&apos;t rush the response. Present one idea or instruction at a time. Use gestures and cues, such as pointing to objects. - Encourage exercise. Exercise benefits everyone, including people with dementia. The main benefits of exercise include improved strength and cardiovascular health. There is growing evidence that exercise also protects the brain from dementia, especially when combined with a healthy diet and treatment for risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Some research also shows physical activity might slow the progression of impaired thinking in people with Alzheimer&apos;s disease. And it can lessen symptoms of depression. - Encourage activity. Plan activities the person with dementia enjoys and can do. Dancing, painting, gardening, cooking, singing and others can be fun, can help you connect with your loved one, and can help your loved one focus on what he or she can still do. - Establish a nighttime ritual. Behavior is often worse at night. Try to establish going-to-bed rituals that are calming and away from the noise of television, meal cleanup and active family members. Leave nightlights on in the bedroom, hall and bathroom to prevent disorientation. Limiting caffeine, discouraging napping and offering opportunities for exercise during the day might ease nighttime restlessness. - Encourage keeping a calendar. A calendar might help your loved one remember upcoming events, daily activities and medication schedules. Consider sharing a calendar with your loved one. - Plan for the future. Develop a plan with your loved one while he or she is able to participate that identifies goals for future care. Support groups, legal advisers, family members and others might be able to help. You&apos;ll need to consider financial and legal issues, safety and daily living concerns, and long-term care options. Several dietary supplements, herbal remedies and therapies have been studied for people with dementia. Some may be beneficial. Use caution when considering taking dietary supplements, vitamins or herbal remedies, especially if you&apos;re taking other medications. These remedies aren&apos;t regulated, and claims about their benefits aren&apos;t always based on scientific research. Some alternative medicines for Alzheimer&apos;s disease and other forms of dementia that have been studied include: - Vitamin E. Evidence for taking vitamin E to slow Alzheimer disease is soft. Doctors warn against taking large doses of vitamin E because it may have a higher risk of mortality, especially in people with heart disease. - Omega-3 fatty acids. There is some evidence that eating fish three times a week might lower your risk of dementia. However, in clinical studies, omega-3 fatty acids haven&apos;t significantly slowed cognitive decline in mild to moderate Alzheimer&apos;s disease. More research is needed. - Ginkgo. Although ginkgo is considered safe, study results have been inconsistent in determining whether ginkgo helps people with dementia. The following techniques may help reduce agitation and promote relaxation in people with dementia. - Music therapy, which involves listening to soothing music - Pet therapy, which involves use of animals, such as visits from dogs, to promote improved moods and behaviors in people with dementia - Aromatherapy, which uses fragrant plant oils - Massage therapy - Art therapy, which involves creating art, focusing on the process rather than the outcome Other therapies The following techniques may help reduce agitation and promote relaxation in people with dementia. - Music therapy, which involves listening to soothing music - Pet therapy, which involves use of animals, such as visits from dogs, to promote improved moods and behaviors in people with dementia - Aromatherapy, which uses fragrant plant oils - Massage therapy - Art therapy, which involves creating art, focusing on the process rather than the outcome</AnswerText>

People can live with diseases such as Alzheimer&apos;s or Parkinson&apos;s dementia for years, so it can be hard to think of these as terminal diseases. But, they do cause death. As they reach the end of life, people suffering from dementia can present special challenges for caregivers. People can live with diseases such as Alzheimer&apos;s or Parkinson&apos;s dementia for years, so it can be hard to think of these as terminal diseases. But, they do cause death. Dementia causes the gradual loss of thinking, remembering, and reasoning abilities, making it difficult for those who want to provide supportive care at the end of life to know what is needed. Because people with advanced dementia can no longer communicate clearly, they cannot share their concerns. Is Uncle Bert refusing food because he&apos;s not hungry or because he&apos;s confused? Why does Grandma Sakura seem agitated? Is she in pain and needs medication to relieve it, but can&apos;t tell you?As these conditions progress, caregivers may find it hard to provide emotional or spiritual comfort. How can you let Grandpa know how much his life has meant to you? How do you make peace with your mother if she no longer knows who you are? Someone who has severe memory loss might not take spiritual comfort from sharing family memories or understand when others express what an important part of their life this person has been. Palliative care or hospice can be helpful in many ways to families of people with dementia.Sensory connections-targeting someone&apos;s senses, like hearing, touch, or sight-can bring comfort. Being touched or massaged can be soothing. Listening to music, white noise, or sounds from nature seem to relax some people and lessen their agitation.When a dementia like Alzheimer&apos;s disease is first diagnosed, if everyone understands that there is no cure, then plans for the end of life can be made before thinking and speaking abilities fail and the person with Alzheimer&apos;s can no longer legally complete documents like advance directives.Learn more about legal and financial planning for people with Alzheimer&apos;s disease.End-of-life care decisions are more complicated for caregivers if the dying person has not expressed the kind of care he or she would prefer. Someone newly diagnosed with Alzheimer&apos;s disease might not be able to imagine the later stages of the disease. Quality of life is an important issue when making healthcare decisions for people with dementia. For example, medicines are available that may delay or keep symptoms from becoming worse for a little while. Medicines also may help control some behavioral symptoms in people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer&apos;s disease.However, some caregivers might not want drugs prescribed for people in the later stages of Alzheimer&apos;s. They may believe that the person&apos;s quality of life is already so poor that the medicine is unlikely to make a difference. If the drug has serious side effects, they may be even more likely to decide against it.When making care decisions for someone else near the end of life, consider the goals of care and weigh the benefits, risks, and side effects of the treatment. You may have to make a treatment decision based on the person&apos;s comfort at one end of the spectrum and extending life or maintaining abilities for a little longer at the other.With dementia, a person&apos;s body may continue to be physically healthy while his or her thinking and memory are deteriorating. This means that caregivers and family members may be faced with very difficult decisions about how treatments that maintain physical health, such as installing a pacemaker, fit within the care goals. Dementia often progresses slowly and unpredictably. Experts suggest that signs of the final stage of Alzheimer&apos;s disease include some of the following:- Being unable to move around on one&apos;s own - Being unable to speak or make oneself understood - Needing help with most, if not all, daily activities, such as eating and self-care - Eating problems such as difficulty swallowingBecause of their unique experience with what happens at the end of life, hospice and palliative care experts might be able to help identify when someone in the final stage of Alzheimer&apos;s disease is in the last days or weeks of life. Caring for people with Alzheimer&apos;s or other dementias at home can be demanding and stressful for the family caregiver. Depression is a problem for some family caregivers, as is fatigue, because many feel they are always on call. Family caregivers may have to cut back on work hours or leave work altogether because of their caregiving responsibilities.Many family members taking care of a person with advanced dementia at home feel relief when death happens-for themselves and for the person who died. It is important to realize such feelings are normal. Hospice-whether used at home or in a facility (such as a nursing home)-gives family caregivers needed support near the end of life, as well as help with their grief, both before and after their family member dies.Caregivers, ask for help when you need it. Learn about respite care.Questions to Ask About End-of-Life Care for a Person with Dementia You will want to understand how the available medical options presented by the healthcare team fit into your family&apos;s particular needs. You might want to ask questions such as: - How will the approach the doctor is suggesting affect your relative&apos;s quality of life? Will it make a difference in comfort and well-being? - If considering home hospice for your relative with dementia, what will be needed to care for him or her? Does the facility have special experience with people with dementia? - What can I expect as the disease gets worse?Read about this topic in Spanish. Lea sobre este tema en espanol. It is common for people to have mixed dementia-a combination of two or more disorders, at least one of which is dementia. A number of combinations are possible. For example, some people have both Alzheimer&apos;s disease and vascular dementia.Some studies indicate that mixed dementia is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. For example, autopsy studies looking at the brains of people who had dementia indicate that most people age 80 and older had mixed dementia-a combination of brain changes related to Alzheimer&apos;s disease (amyloid and tau), cerebrovascular disease (such as stroke), and, in some instances, Lewy body dementia (Lewy bodies). These studies suggest that mixed dementia is caused by both Alzheimer&apos;s-related neurodegenerative processes and vascular disease-related processes.In a person with mixed dementia, it may not be clear exactly how many of a person&apos;s symptoms are due to Alzheimer&apos;s or another type of dementia. In one study, approximately 40 percent of people who were thought to have Alzheimer&apos;s were found after autopsy to also have some form of cerebrovascular disease. In addition, several studies have found that many of the major risk factors for vascular disease also may be risk factors for Alzheimer&apos;s disease.Researchers are still working to understand how underlying disease processes in mixed dementia influence each other. It is not clear, for example, if symptoms are likely to be worse when a person has brain changes reflecting multiple types of dementia. Nor do we know if a person with multiple dementias can benefit from treating one type, for example, when a person with Alzheimer&apos;s controls high blood pressure and other vascular disease risk factors.

Nor do we know if a person with multiple dementias can benefit from treating one type, for example, when a person with Alzheimer&apos;s controls high blood pressure and other vascular disease risk factors. Vascular dementia, considered the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer&apos;s disease, and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) result from injuries to the vessels supplying blood to the brain, often after a stroke or series of strokes. Vascular dementia and VCI arise as a result of risk factors that similarly increase the risk for cerebrovascular disease (such as stroke), including atrial fibrillation, hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetes, and high cholesterol. The symptoms of vascular dementia can be similar to those of Alzheimer&apos;s, and both conditions can occur at the same time. Symptoms of vascular dementia can begin suddenly and worsen or improve during one&apos;s lifetime.This type of dementia is often managed with drugs to prevent strokes. The aim is to reduce the risk of additional brain damage. Some studies suggest that drugs that improve memory in Alzheimer&apos;s disease might benefit people with early vascular dementia. Interventions that address risk factors may be incorporated into the management of vascular dementia.Some types of vascular dementia include:Multi-infarct dementia. This type of dementia occurs when a person has had many small strokes that damage brain cells. One side of the body may be disproportionally affected, and multi-infarct dementia may impair language or other functions, depending on the region of the brain that is affected. When the strokes occur on both sides of the brain, dementia is more likely than when stroke occurs on one side of the brain. In some cases, a single stroke can damage the brain enough to cause dementia. This so-called single-infarct dementia is more common when stroke affects the left side of the brain-where speech centers are located-and/or when it involves the hippocampus, the part of the brain that is vital for memory.Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). This inherited form of cardiovascular disease results in a thickening of the walls of small- and medium-sized blood vessels, eventually stemming the flow of blood to the brain. It is associated with mutations of a gene called Notch3. CADASIL is associated with multi-infarct dementia, stroke, migraine with aura (migraine preceded by visual symptoms), and mood disorders. The first symptoms can appear in people between ages 20 and 40. Many people with CADASIL are undiagnosed. People with first-degree relatives who have CADASIL can be tested for genetic mutations to the Notch3 gene to determine their own risk of developing CADASIL.Subcortical vascular dementia, also called Binswanger&apos;s disease. This rare form of dementia involves extensive damage to the small blood vessels and nerve fibers that make up white matter, the &quot;network&quot; part of the brain believed to be critical for relaying messages between regions. The symptoms of Binswanger&apos;s are related to the disruption of subcortical neural circuits involving short-term memory, organization, mood, attention, decision making, and appropriate behavior. A characteristic feature of this disease is psychomotor slowness, such as an increase in the time it takes for a person to think of a letter and then write it on a piece of paper.For more information about vascular dementia and VCI, see NIA&apos;s list of resources.

Some caregivers need help when the person is in the early stages of Alzheimer&apos;s disease. Other caregivers look for help when the person is in the later stages of Alzheimer&apos;s. It&apos;s okay to seek help whenever you need it.As the person moves through the stages of Alzheimer&apos;s, he or she will need more care. One reason is that medicines used to treat Alzheimer&apos;s disease can only control symptoms; they cannot cure the disease. Symptoms, such as memory loss and confusion, will get worse over time.Because of this, you will need more help. You may feel that asking for help shows weakness or a lack of caring, but the opposite is true. Asking for help shows your strength. It means you know your limits and when to seek support.

Many of these publications are in both English and Spanish. They can be viewed, printed, and ordered online. Various disorders and factors contribute to the development of dementia. Neurodegenerative disorders result in a progressive and irreversible loss of neurons and brain functioning. Currently, there are no cures for these types of disorders. They include:- Alzheimer&apos;s disease - Frontotemporal disorders - Lewy body dementiaOther types of progressive brain disease include:- Vascular dementia and vascular cognitive impairment - Mixed dementia, a combination of two or more disorders, at least one of which is dementiaOther types of dementia can often be halted or even reversed with treatment. For example, normal pressure hydrocephalus, an abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, often resolves with treatment.In addition, certain medical conditions can cause serious memory problems that resemble dementia. These problems should go away once the conditions are treated. These conditions include:- Side effects of certain medicines - Depression - Certain vitamin deficiencies - Drinking too much alcohol - Blood clots or tumors in the brain - Head injury, such as a concussion from a fall or accident - Thyroid, kidney, or liver problemsDoctors have identified many other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms. These conditions include:- Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare brain disorder - Huntington&apos;s disease, a hereditary disorder caused by a faulty gene - Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), caused by repeated traumatic brain injury - Subdural hematoma, bleeding between the brain&apos;s surface and its outer coveringThe overlap in symptoms of various dementias can make it hard to get an accurate diagnosis. But a proper diagnosis is important to get the right treatment.

Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning-thinking, remembering, and reasoning-and behavioral abilities to such an extent that it interferes with a person&apos;s daily life and activities. Dementia ranges in severity from the mildest stage, when it is just beginning to affect a person&apos;s functioning, to the most severe stage, when the person must depend completely on others for basic activities of living.Signs and symptoms of dementia result when once-healthy neurons (nerve cells) in the brain stop working, lose connections with other brain cells, and die. While everyone loses some neurons as they age, people with dementia experience far greater loss.While dementia is more common as people grow older (up to half of all people age 85 or older may have some form of dementia), it is not a normal part of aging. Many people live into their 90s and beyond without any signs of dementia. One type of dementia, frontotemporal disorders, is more common in middle-aged than older adults.Memory loss, though common, is not the only sign of dementia. For a person to have dementia, he or she must have:- Two or more core mental functions that are impaired. These functions include memory, language skills, visual perception, and the ability to focus and pay attention. These also include cognitive skills such as the ability to reason and solve problems. - A loss of brain function severe enough that a person cannot do normal, everyday tasksIn addition, some people with dementia cannot control their emotions. Their personalities may change. They can have delusions, which are strong beliefs without proof, such as the idea that someone is stealing from them. They also may hallucinate, seeing or otherwise experiencing things that are not real.The causes of dementia can vary, depending on the types of brain changes that may be taking place. Other dementias include Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal disorders, and vascular dementia.

If you do not see an aging friend or relative often, changes in his or her health may seem dramatic. In contrast, the primary caregiver might not notice such changes or realize that more help, medical treatment, or supervision is needed. Or, the primary caregiver might not want to accept the fact that the health of his or her spouse or parent is failing. Sometimes a geriatric care manager or other professional is the first to notice changes.For families dealing with Alzheimer&apos;s disease or another dementia, it can be easier to cover for the person-doing things for him or her, filling in information in conversations, and so on-than to acknowledge what is happening.As a caregiver, you can provide support by helping an aging friend or relative get the care they need.A few good questions to help you start the conversation with the primary caregiver are:- If you thought there might be a change in Aunt Joan&apos;s condition, whose opinion would you seek? - I didn&apos;t notice Dad repeating himself so much the last time I was here.

Before you raise the issue of what needs to be done, talk to your parent and the primary caregiver about your concerns.Try not to sound critical when you raise the subject. Instead, mention your particular worry, for example, &quot;Mom, it looks like you don&apos;t have much food in the house-are you having trouble getting to the store?&quot; and explain why you are asking. Listen to what the primary caregiver says about the situation and whether he or she believes there are problems.Discuss what you think could be done. For example, you could ask:- Would you like me to arrange to have groceries delivered on a regular basis? - Do we need to get a second opinion about the diagnosis? - Can you follow the medication schedule? - Would you like some help with housework?Try to follow your suggestions with practical help, and give specific examples of what you can do. For example, you might arrange to have a personal or home health aide come in once a week. You might schedule doctors&apos; appointments or arrange for transportation.In some cases, you may have to be forceful, especially if you feel that the situation is unhealthy or unsafe. Do not leave a frail adult at risk. If you have to act against the wishes of your parent or the primary caregiver, be direct and explain what you are going to do. Discuss your plan, and say why you are taking action.Find more tips for long-distance caregivers. If you do not see an aging friend or relative often, changes in his or her health may seem dramatic. In contrast, the primary caregiver might not notice such changes or realize that more help, medical treatment, or supervision is needed. Or, the primary caregiver might not want to accept the fact that the health of his or her spouse or parent is failing. Sometimes a geriatric care manager or other professional is the first to notice changes.For families dealing with Alzheimer&apos;s disease or another dementia, it can be easier to cover for the person-doing things for him or her, filling in information in conversations, and so on-than to acknowledge what is happening.As a caregiver, you can provide support by helping an aging friend or relative get the care they need.A few good questions to help you start the conversation with the primary caregiver are:- If you thought there might be a change in Aunt Joan&apos;s condition, whose opinion would you seek? - I didn&apos;t notice Dad repeating himself so much the last time I was here.

To diagnose dementia, doctors first assess whether a person has an underlying treatable condition such as depression, abnormal thyroid function, normal pressure hydrocephalus, or vitamin B12 deficiency. Early diagnosis is important, as some causes for symptoms can be treated. In many cases, the specific type of dementia a person has may not be confirmed until after the person has died and the brain is examined.A medical assessment for dementia generally includes:- Patient history. Typical questions about a person&apos;s medical and family history might include asking about whether dementia runs in the family, how and when symptoms began, changes in behavior and personality, and if the person is taking certain medications that might cause or worsen symptoms. - Physical exam. Measuring blood pressure and other vital signs may help physicians detect conditions that might cause or occur with dementia. Such conditions may be treatable. - Neurological tests. Assessing balance, sensory function, reflexes, vision, eye movements, and other cognitive functions helps identify conditions that may affect the diagnosis or are treatable with drugs.

Assessing balance, sensory function, reflexes, vision, eye movements, and other cognitive functions helps identify conditions that may affect the diagnosis or are treatable with drugs. The following procedures also may be used to diagnose dementia:- Cognitive and neuropsychological tests. These tests measure memory, problem solving, attention, counting, language skills, and other abilities related to mental functioning. - Laboratory tests. Blood and urine tests can help find or rule out possible causes of symptoms. - Brain scans. These tests can identify strokes, tumors, and other problems that can cause dementia. Scans also identify changes in the brain&apos;s structure and function. The most common scans are: - Computed tomography (CT), which uses X-rays to produce images of the brain and other organs - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of body structures, including tissues, organs, bones, and nerves - Positron emission tomography (PET), which uses radiation to provide pictures of brain activity - Psychiatric evaluation. This evaluation will help determine if depression or another mental health condition is causing or contributing to a person&apos;s symptoms. - Genetic tests. Some dementias are caused by a known gene defect. In these cases, a genetic test can help people know if they are at risk for dementia. People should talk with family members, a primary care doctor, and a genetic counselor before getting tested. Visiting a family doctor is often the first step for people who are experiencing changes in thinking, movement, or behavior. However, neurologists-doctors who specialize in disorders of the brain and nervous system-generally have the expertise needed to diagnose dementia. Geriatric psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, and geriatricians may also be skilled in diagnosing the condition.If a specialist cannot be found in your community, ask the neurology department of the nearest medical school for a referral. A hospital affiliated with a medical school may also have a dementia or movement disorders clinic that provides expert evaluation.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Dementia - home care: Dementia is a loss of brain function that occurs with certain diseases. It affects memory, thinking, and behavior. A loved one with dementia will need support in the home as the disease gets worse. You can help by trying to understand how the person with dementia perceives his or her world. Give the person a chance to talk about any challenges and take part in his or her own daily care. Start by talking with your loved one&apos;s health care provider. Ask how you can: - Help the person stay calm and oriented - Make dressing and grooming easier - Talk to the person - Help with memory loss - Manage behavior and sleep problems Tips for reducing confusion in people with dementia include: - Have familiar objects and people around. - Keep lights on at night. - Use reminders, notes, lists of routine tasks, or directions for daily activities. - Stick to a simple activity schedule. Taking regular walks with a caregiver can help improve communication skills and prevent wandering. Calming music may reduce wandering and restlessness, ease anxiety, and improve sleep and behavior. People with dementia should have their eyes and ears checked. If problems are found, hearing aids, glasses, or cataract surgery may be needed. People with dementia should also have regular driving tests. At some point, it won&apos;t be safe for them to continue to drive. This may not be an easy conversation, so seek help from their provider and other family members. State laws vary on the ability of a person with dementia to continue to drive. Supervised meals can help with feeding. People with dementia often forget to eat and drink, and can become dehydrated as a result. Talk to the provider about the need for extra calories due to increased physical activity from restlessness and wandering. Also talk to the provider about: - Watching for risk of choking and what to do if choking occurs - How to increase safety in the home - How to prevent falls - Ways to improve bathroom safety The Alzheimer&apos;s Association&apos;s Safe Return Program requires people with dementia to wear an identification bracelet. If they wander, their caregiver can contact the police and the national Safe Return office, where information about them is stored and shared nationwide. Eventually, people with dementia may need 24-hour monitoring and assistance to provide a safe environment, control aggressive or agitated behavior, and meet their needs. LONG-TERM CARE A person with dementia may need monitoring and help at home or in an institution. Possible options include: - Adult day care - Boarding homes - Nursing homes - In-home care Many organizations are available to help you care for a person with dementia. They include: - Adult protective services - Community resources - Local or state government departments of aging - Visiting nurses or aides - Volunteer services In some communities, dementia-related support groups may be available. Family counseling can help family members cope with home care. Advance directives, power of attorney, and other legal actions may make it easier to decide on care for the person with dementia. Seek legal advice early, before the person is unable to make these decisions.

				<AnswerText>Dementia (TYPES OF DEMENTIA): Various disorders and factors contribute to the development of dementia. Neurodegenerative disorders result in a progressive and irreversible loss of neurons and brain functioning. Currently, there are no cures for these types of disorders. They include:- Alzheimer&apos;s disease - Frontotemporal disorders - Lewy body dementiaOther types of progressive brain disease include:- Vascular dementia and vascular cognitive impairment - Mixed dementia, a combination of two or more disorders, at least one of which is dementiaOther types of dementia can often be halted or even reversed with treatment. For example, normal pressure hydrocephalus, an abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, often resolves with treatment.In addition, certain medical conditions can cause serious memory problems that resemble dementia. These problems should go away once the conditions are treated. These conditions include:- Side effects of certain medicines - Depression - Certain vitamin deficiencies - Drinking too much alcohol - Blood clots or tumors in the brain - Head injury, such as a concussion from a fall or accident - Thyroid, kidney, or liver problemsDoctors have identified many other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms. These conditions include:- Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare brain disorder - Huntington&apos;s disease, a hereditary disorder caused by a faulty gene - Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), caused by repeated traumatic brain injury - Subdural hematoma, bleeding between the brain&apos;s surface and its outer coveringThe overlap in symptoms of various dementias can make it hard to get an accurate diagnosis. But a proper diagnosis is important to get the right treatment. Seek help from a neurologist-a doctor who specializes in disorders of the brain and nervous system-or other medical specialist who knows about dementia.Learn more about dementia from MedlinePlus.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What causes Dementia?: Dementia usually occurs in older age. It is rare in people under age 60. The risk of dementia increases as a person gets older. Most types of dementia are nonreversible (degenerative). Nonreversible means the changes in the brain that are causing the dementia cannot be stopped or turned back. Alzheimer disease is the most common type of dementia. Another common type of dementia is vascular dementia. It is caused by many small strokes. Lewy body disease is a common cause of dementia in the elderly. People with this condition have abnormal protein structures in certain areas of the brain. The following medical conditions can also lead to dementia: - Huntington disease - Brain injury - Multiple sclerosis - Infections such as HIV/AIDS, syphilis,and Lyme disease - Parkinson disease - Pick disease - Progressive supranuclear palsy Some causes of dementia may be stopped or reversed if they are found soon enough, including: - Brain injury - Brain tumors - Chronic alcohol abuse - Changes in blood sugar, sodium, and calcium levels (dementia due to metabolic causes) - Low vitamin B12 level - Normal pressure hydrocephalus - Use of certain medicines, including cimetidine and some cholesterol drugs</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Dementia (WHAT IS DEMENTIA?): Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning-thinking, remembering, and reasoning-and behavioral abilities to such an extent that it interferes with a person&apos;s daily life and activities. Dementia ranges in severity from the mildest stage, when it is just beginning to affect a person&apos;s functioning, to the most severe stage, when the person must depend completely on others for basic activities of living.Signs and symptoms of dementia result when once-healthy neurons (nerve cells) in the brain stop working, lose connections with other brain cells, and die. While everyone loses some neurons as they age, people with dementia experience far greater loss.While dementia is more common as people grow older (up to half of all people age 85 or older may have some form of dementia), it is not a normal part of aging. Many people live into their 90s and beyond without any signs of dementia. One type of dementia, frontotemporal disorders, is more common in middle-aged than older adults.Memory loss, though common, is not the only sign of dementia. For a person to have dementia, he or she must have:- Two or more core mental functions that are impaired. These functions include memory, language skills, visual perception, and the ability to focus and pay attention. These also include cognitive skills such as the ability to reason and solve problems. - A loss of brain function severe enough that a person cannot do normal, everyday tasksIn addition, some people with dementia cannot control their emotions. Their personalities may change. They can have delusions, which are strong beliefs without proof, such as the idea that someone is stealing from them. They also may hallucinate, seeing or otherwise experiencing things that are not real.The causes of dementia can vary, depending on the types of brain changes that may be taking place. Other dementias include Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal disorders, and vascular dementia. It is common for people to have mixed dementia-a combination of two or more disorders, at least one of which is dementia. For example, some people have both Alzheimer&apos;s disease and vascular dementia.Learn more about dementia from MedlinePlus.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Dementia (Definition): Dementia is not a specific disease. It is a descriptive term for a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of disorders that affect the brain. People with dementia have significantly impaired intellectual functioning that interferes with normal activities and relationships. They also lose their ability to solve problems and maintain emotional control, and they may experience personality changes and behavioral problems, such as agitation, delusions, and hallucinations. While memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, memory loss by itself does not mean that a person has dementia. Doctors diagnose dementia only if two or more brain functions - such as memory and language skills -- are significantly impaired without loss of consciousness.  Some of the diseases that can cause symptoms of dementia are Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington’s disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.  Doctors have identified other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms including reactions to medications, metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, infections, poisoning, brain tumors, anoxia or hypoxia (conditions in which the brain’s oxygen supply is either reduced or cut off entirely), and heart and lung problems.  Although it is common in very elderly individuals, dementia is not a normal part of the aging process.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Dementia (Symptoms): Dementia symptoms include difficulty with many areas of mental function, including: - Emotional behavior or personality - Language - Memory - Perception - Thinking and judgment (cognitive skills) Dementia usually first appears as forgetfulness. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the stage between normal forgetfulness due to aging and the development of dementia. People with MCI have mild problems with thinking and memory that do not interfere with daily activities. They often know about their forgetfulness. Not everyone with MCI develops dementia. Symptoms of MCI include: - Difficulty doing more than one task at a time - Difficulty solving problems or making decisions - Forgetting recent events or conversations - Taking longer to do more difficult mental activities Early symptoms of dementia can include: - Difficulty with tasks that take some thought, but that used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing games (such as bridge), and learning new information or routines - Getting lost on familiar routes - Language problems, such as trouble with the names of familiar objects - Losing interest in things previously enjoyed, flat mood - Misplacing items - Personality changes and loss of social skills, which can lead to inappropriate behaviors As dementia becomes worse, symptoms are more obvious and interfere with the ability to take care of oneself. Symptoms may include: - Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at night - Difficulty with basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, or driving - Forgetting details about current events - Forgetting events in one&apos;s own life history, losing self-awareness - Having hallucinations, arguments, striking out, and violent behavior - Having delusions, depression, agitation - More difficulty reading or writing - Poor judgment and loss of ability to recognize danger - Using the wrong word, not pronouncing words correctly, speaking in confusing sentences - Withdrawing from social contact People with severe dementia can no longer: - Perform basic activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, and bathing - Recognize family members - Understand language Other symptoms that may occur with dementia: - Problems controlling bowel movements or urine - Swallowing problems</AnswerText>

Early symptoms of dementia can include: - Difficulty performing tasks that used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing games (such as bridge), and learning new information or routines - Getting lost on familiar routes - Language problems, such as trouble finding the name of familiar objects - Losing interest in things you previously enjoyed, flat mood - Misplacing items - Personality changes and loss of social skills As dementia worsens, symptoms are more obvious and the ability to take care of oneself declines. Symptoms may include: - Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at night - Difficulty doing basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, or driving - Forgetting details about current events - Forgetting events in your own life history, losing awareness of who you are - Having delusions, depression, or agitation - Having hallucinations, arguments, striking out, or violent behavior - Having more difficulty reading or writing - Having poor judgment and loss of ability to recognize danger - Using the wrong word, not pronouncing words correctly, or speaking in confusing sentences - Withdrawing from social contact Nervous system (neurologic) problems that occur with a stroke may also be present.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Vascular dementia (Symptoms): Vascular dementia symptoms vary, depending on the part of your brain where blood flow is impaired. Symptoms often overlap with those of other types of dementia, especially Alzheimer&apos;s disease. Vascular dementia symptoms may be most clear-cut when they occur suddenly following a stroke. When changes in your thinking and reasoning seem clearly linked to a stroke, this condition is sometimes called post-stroke dementia. Another characteristic pattern of vascular dementia symptoms sometimes follows a series of strokes or mini strokes. In this pattern, changes in your thought processes occur in noticeable steps downward from your previous level of function, unlike the gradual, steady decline that typically occurs in Alzheimer&apos;s disease. But vascular dementia can also develop very gradually, just like Alzheimer&apos;s disease. What&apos;s more, vascular dementia and Alzheimer&apos;s often occur together. Studies show that people with dementia symptoms usually have brain changes typical of more than one type. Some doctors call this condition mixed dementia. Vascular dementia symptoms include: - Confusion - Trouble paying attention and concentrating - Reduced ability to organize thoughts or actions - Decline in ability to analyze a situation, develop an effective plan and communicate that plan to others - Difficulty deciding what to do next - Problems with memory - Restlessness and agitation - Unsteady gait - Sudden or frequent urge to urinate or inability to control passing urine - Depression</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Frontotemporal dementia (Symptoms): Identifying precisely which diseases fall into the category of frontotemporal dementia presents a particular challenge to scientists. The signs and symptoms may vary greatly from one individual to the next. Researchers have identified several clusters of symptoms that tend to occur together and are dominant in subgroups of people with the disorder. More than one symptom cluster may be apparent in the same person. The signs and symptoms of frontotemporal dementia progressively worsen with time, almost always over years. Eventually, people require 24-hour care. The most common signs and symptoms of frontotemporal dementia involve extreme changes in behavior and personality. These include: - Increasingly inappropriate actions - Loss of empathy and other interpersonal skills - Lack of judgment and inhibition - Apathy - Repetitive compulsive behavior - A decline in personal hygiene - Changes in eating habits, predominantly overeating - Oral exploration and consumption of inedible objects - Lack of awareness of thinking or behavioral changes Some subtypes of frontotemporal dementia are marked by the impairment or loss of speech and language difficulties. Two types of primary progressive aphasia are considered frontotemporal dementia. Primary progressive aphasia is characterized by an increasing difficulty in using and understanding written and spoken language. For example, people may have trouble finding the right word to use in speech or naming objects. Semantic dementia is one type of primary progressive aphasia. It&apos;s also known as semantic variant primary progressive aphasia. Individuals with semantic dementia have prominent difficulty naming (anomia) and may replace a specific word with a more general word such as &quot;it&quot; for pen. They may also lose knowledge of word meaning. Progressive agrammatic (nonfluent) aphasia is another type of primary progressive aphasia characterized by nonfluent and hesitant speech. Speech may sound telegraphic with misuse of pronouns and errors in sentence construction. Rarer subtypes of frontotemporal dementia are characterized by problems with movement, similar to those associated with Parkinson&apos;s disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Movement-related signs and symptoms may include: - Tremor - Rigidity - Muscle spasms - Poor coordination - Difficulty swallowing - Muscle weakness</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Myopathy with extrapyramidal signs: Myopathy with extrapyramidal signs is a disorder characterized by early childhood onset of proximal muscle weakness (muscles closest to the body’s midline) and learning disabilities. The muscle weakness does not progress, but most patients develop progressive atypical involuntary muscle contractions that influence gait, movement, and posture (extrapyramidal signs) that may be disabling. Signs and symptoms are variable and include brief, repetitive, jerky and uncontrolled movements caused by muscle contractions ( chorea), tremor, abnormal posturing, and involuntary repetitive movements of the mouth and face. [1]  Other symptoms may include uncoordinated movements ( ataxia ), a very small head ( microcephaly ), drooping of the eyelids, wasting of the eye nerve ( optic atrophy), and axonal peripheral neuropathy. It is caused by changes ( mutations ) in the MICU1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive   pattern. [1] [2] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency).

				<AnswerText>Dementia (Treatment): Most types of dementia can&apos;t be cured, but there are ways to manage your symptoms. Medications The following are used to temporarily improve dementia symptoms. - Cholinesterase inhibitors. These medications - including donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon) and galantamine (Razadyne) - work by boosting levels of a chemical messenger involved in memory and judgment. Although primarily used to treat Alzheimer&apos;s disease, these medications might also be prescribed for other dementias, including vascular dementia, Parkinson&apos;s disease dementia and Lewy body dementia. Side effects can include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. - Memantine. Memantine (Namenda) works by regulating the activity of glutamate, another chemical messenger involved in brain functions, such as learning and memory. In some cases, memantine is prescribed with a cholinesterase inhibitor. A common side effect of memantine is dizziness. - Other medications. Your doctor might prescribe medications to treat other symptoms or conditions, such as depression, sleep disturbances or agitation. Therapies Several dementia symptoms and behavior problems might be treated initially using nondrug approaches, such as: - Occupational therapy. An occupational therapist can show you how to make your home safer and teach coping behaviors. The purpose is to prevent accidents, such as falls; manage behavior; and prepare you for the dementia progression. - Modifying the environment. Reducing clutter and noise can make it easier for someone with dementia to focus and function. You might need to hide objects that can threaten safety, such as knives and car keys. Monitoring systems can alert you if the person with dementia wanders. - Modifying tasks. Break tasks into easier steps and focus on success, not failure. Structure and routine also help reduce confusion in people with dementia.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What are the treatments for Dementia?: Drugs to specifically treat Alzheimers disease and some other progressive dementias are now available. Although these drugs do not halt the disease or reverse existing brain damage, they can improve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. This may improve an individuals quality of life, ease the burden on caregivers, or delay admission to a nursing home. Many researchers are also examining whether these drugs may be useful for treating other types of dementia. Many people with dementia, particularly those in the early stages, may benefit from practicing tasks designed to improve performance in specific aspects of cognitive functioning. For example, people can sometimes be taught to use memory aids, such as mnemonics, computerized recall devices, or note taking.</AnswerText>

Sometimes, dementia medicine can make a patient&apos;s confusion worse. Stopping or changing these medicines is part of the treatment. Certain mental exercises can help with dementia. Treating conditions that can lead to confusion often greatly improve mental function. Such conditions include: - Anemia - Congestive heart failure - Decreased blood oxygen (hypoxia) - Depression - Heart failure - Infections - Nutritional disorders - Thyroid disorders Medicines may be used to: - Slow the rate at which symptoms get worse, though improvement with these drugs may be small - Control problems with behavior, such as loss of judgment or confusion Someone with dementia will need support in the homeas the disease gets worse. Family members or other caregivers can help by helping the person cope with memory lossand behavior and sleep problems.

Medications - Antidepressants. Some types of antidepressants, such as trazodone, may reduce the behavioral problems associated with frontotemporal dementia. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) - such as sertraline (Zoloft) or fluvoxamine (Luvox) - also have been effective in some people. - Antipsychotics. Antipsychotic medications, such as olanzapine (Zyprexa) or quetiapine (Seroquel), are sometimes used to combat the behavioral problems of frontotemporal dementia. However, these medications must be used with caution because the side effects include an increased risk of death in dementia patients.

				<AnswerText>Lewy body dementia (Treatment): Treatment can be challenging, and there&apos;s no cure for Lewy body dementia. Doctors treat the individual symptoms. Medications - Cholinesterase inhibitors. These Alzheimer&apos;s disease medications, such as rivastigmine (Exelon), work by increasing the levels of chemical messengers believed to be important for memory, thought and judgment (neurotransmitters) in the brain. This can help improve alertness and cognition, and may help reduce hallucinations and other behavioral problems. Possible side effects may include gastrointestinal upset, excessive salivation and tearing, and frequent urination. These are not FDA approved for Lewy body dementia. - Parkinson&apos;s disease medications. These medications, such as carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet) may help reduce parkinsonian symptoms, such as rigid muscles and slow movement. However, these medications may also increase confusion, hallucinations and delusions. - Medications to treat other symptoms. Your doctor may prescribe medications to treat other symptoms associated with Lewy body dementia, such as sleep or movement problems. If possible, avoid medications with anticholinergic properties, which can worsen cognition or dopamine agonists, which can cause hallucinations. First-generation antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol (Haldol), should not be used to treat Lewy body dementia. They may cause severe confusion, severe Parkinsonism, sedation and sometimes even death. Very rarely, certain second-generation antipsychotics may be prescribed for a short time at a low dose but only if the benefits outweigh the risks. Therapies Because antipsychotic drugs can worsen Lewy body dementia symptoms, it might be helpful to initially try nondrug approaches, such as: - Tolerating the behavior. Many times a person with Lewy body dementia isn&apos;t distressed by the hallucinations. In these cases, the side effects of medication may be worse than the hallucinations themselves. - Modifying the environment. Reducing clutter and distracting noise can make it easier for someone with dementia to function. - Offering soothing responses. A caregiver&apos;s response may worsen behavior. Avoid correcting and quizzing a person with dementia. Offer reassurance and validation of his or her concerns. - Creating daily routines and keeping tasks simple. Break tasks into easier steps and focus on successes, not failures. Structure and routine during the day can be less confusing.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Vascular dementia (Treatment): Controlling underlying conditions and risk factors Controlling conditions that affect the underlying health of your heart and blood vessels can sometimes slow the rate at which vascular dementia gets worse, and may also sometimes prevent further decline. Depending on your individual situation, your doctor may prescribe medications to: - Lower your blood pressure - Reduce your cholesterol level - Prevent your blood from clotting and keep your arteries clear - Help control your blood sugar if you have diabetes Alzheimer&apos;s medications The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any drugs specifically to treat changes in judgment, planning, memory and other thought processes caused by vascular dementia. However, certain medications approved by the FDA to treat these symptoms in Alzheimer&apos;s disease may also help people with vascular dementia to the same modest extent they help those with Alzheimer&apos;s. Doctors may prescribe one or both types of the following Alzheimer&apos;s drugs: - Cholinesterase inhibitors - including donepezil (Aricept), galantamine (Razadyne) and rivastigmine (Exelon) - work by boosting levels of a brain cell chemical messenger involved in memory and judgment. Side effects can include nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps and diarrhea. - Memantine (Namenda) regulates another brain cell chemical messenger important for information processing, storage and retrieval.

				<AnswerText>Insulin, Medicines, and Other Diabetes Treatments (Do I have other treatment options for my diabetes?): When medicines and lifestyle changes are not enough to manage your diabetes, a less common treatment may be an option. Other treatments include bariatric surgery for certain people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and an &quot;artificial pancreas&quot; and pancreatic islet transplantation for some people with type 1 diabetes.Bariatric surgeryAlso called weight-loss surgery or metabolic surgery, bariatric surgery may help some people with obesity and type 2 diabetes lose a large amount of weight and regain normal blood glucose levels. Some people with diabetes may no longer need their diabetes medicine after bariatric surgery. Whether and for how long blood glucose levels improve seems to vary by the patient, type of weight-loss surgery, and amount of weight the person loses. Other factors include how long someone has had diabetes and whether or not the person uses insulin.1Recent research suggests that weight-loss surgery also may help improve blood glucose control in people with type 1 diabetes who are obese.2Researchers are studying the long-term results of bariatric surgery in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.Artificial PancreasThe NIDDK has played an important role in developing “artificial pancreas” technology. An artificial pancreas replaces manual blood glucose testing and the use of insulin shots or a pump. A single system monitors blood glucose levels around the clock and provides insulin or a combination of insulin and a second hormone, glucagon, automatically. The system can also be monitored remotely, for example by parents or medical staff.In 2016, the FDA approved a type of artificial pancreas system called a hybrid closed-loop system. This system tests your glucose level every 5 minutes throughout the day and night, and automatically gives you the right amount of insulin.You still need to manually adjust the amount of insulin the pump delivers at mealtimes. But, the artificial pancreas may free you from some of the daily tasks needed to keep your blood glucose stable—or help you sleep through the night without the need to wake and test your glucose or take medicine.The hybrid closed-loop system is expected to be available in the U.S. in 2017. Talk with your health care provider about whether this system might be right for you.The NIDDK has funded several important studies on different types of artificial pancreas devices to better help people with type 1 diabetes manage their disease. The devices may also help people with type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes.Pancreatic islet transplantationPancreatic islet transplantation is an experimental treatment for poorly controlled type 1 diabetes. Pancreatic islets are clusters of cells in the pancreas that make the hormone insulin. In type 1 diabetes, the body’s immune system attacks these cells. A pancreatic islet transplant replaces destroyed islets with new ones that make and release insulin. This procedure takes islets from the pancreas of an organ donor and transfers them to a person with type 1 diabetes. Because researchers are still studying pancreatic islet transplantation, the procedure is only available to people enrolled in research studies.

				<AnswerText>Vascular dementia (Treatment): There is no treatment to turn back damage to the brain caused by small strokes. An important goal is to control symptoms and correct the risk factors. To prevent future strokes: - Avoid fatty foods. Follow a healthy, low-fat diet. - DO NOT drink more than 1 to 2 alcoholic drinks a day. - Keep blood pressure lower than 130/80 mm/Hg. Ask your doctor what your blood pressure should be. - Keep LDL &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol lower than 70 mg/dL. - Do not smoke. - The doctor may suggest blood thinners, such as aspirin, to help prevent blood clots from forming in the arteries. DO NOT start taking aspirin or stop taking it without talking to your doctor first. The goals of helping someone with dementia in the home are to: - Manage behavior problems, confusion, sleep problems, and agitation - Remove safety hazards in the home - Support family members and other caregivers Medicines may be needed to control aggressive, agitated, or dangerous behaviors.

Sometimes, people with Pick disease take the same medicines used to treat other types of dementia. In some cases, stopping or changing medicines that worsen confusion or that are not needed can improve thinking and other mental functions. Medicines include: - Analgesics - Anticholinergics - Central nervous system depressants - Cimetidine - Lidocaine It is important to treat any disorders that can cause confusion. These include: - Anemia - Decreased oxygen (hypoxia) level - Heart failure - High carbon dioxide level - Infections - Kidney failure - Liver failure - Nutritional disorders - Thyroid disorders - Mood disorders, such as depression Medicines may be needed to control aggressive, dangerous, or agitated behaviors. Behavior modification can help some people control unacceptable or dangerous behaviors. This consists of rewarding appropriate or positive behaviors and ignoring inappropriate behaviors (when it is safe to do so). Talk therapy (psychotherapy) does not always work. This is because it can cause further confusion or disorientation. Reality orientation, which reinforces environmental and other cues, may help reduce disorientation. Depending on the symptoms and severity of the disease, monitoring and help with personal hygiene and self-care may be needed. Eventually, there may be a need for 24-hour care and monitoring at home or in a special facility. Family counseling can help the person cope with the changes needed for home care. Care may include: - Adult protective services - Community resources - Homemakers - Visiting nurses or aides - Volunteer services People with Pick disease and their family may need to seek legal advice early in the course of the disorder. Advance care directive, power of attorney, and other legal actions can make it easier to make decisions regarding the care of the person with Pick disease.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Dementia (Diagnosis): Diagnosing dementia and determining what type it is can be challenging. A diagnosis of dementia requires that at least two core mental functions be impaired enough to interfere with daily living. They are memory, language skills, ability to focus and pay attention, ability to reason and problem-solve, and visual perception. Your doctor will review your medical history and symptoms and conduct a physical examination. He or she will likely ask someone close to you about your symptoms, as well. No single test can diagnose dementia, so doctors are likely to run a number of tests that can help pinpoint the problem. Cognitive and neuropsychological tests Doctors will evaluate your thinking (cognitive) function. A number of tests measure thinking skills such as memory, orientation, reasoning and judgment, language skills, and attention. Neurological evaluation Doctors evaluate your memory, language, visual perception, attention, problem-solving, movement, senses, balance, reflexes and other areas. Brain scans - CT or MRI. These scans can check for evidence of stroke or bleeding or tumor or hydrocephalus. - PET scans. These can show patterns of brain activity and if the amyloid protein, a hallmark of Alzheimer&apos;s disease, has been deposited in the brain. Laboratory tests Simple blood tests can detect physical problems that can affect brain function, such as vitamin B-12 deficiency or an underactive thyroid gland. Sometimes the spinal fluid is examined for infection, inflammation or markers of some degenerative diseases. Psychiatric evaluation A mental health professional can determine whether depression or another mental health condition is contributing to your symptoms.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Lewy body dementia (Diagnosis): A progressive decline in your ability to think is required to diagnose Lewy body dementia. In addition, two of the following core symptoms must be present: - Fluctuating and unpredictable alertness and thinking (cognitive) function - Repeated visual hallucinations - Parkinsonian symptoms - REM sleep behavior disorder, in which people act out their dreams during sleep In addition to the core symptoms of Lewy body dementia, tests for certain biomarkers can further support a diagnosis of Lewy body dementia. Biomarkers are substances in the blood that indicate the presence of a disease, such as Lewy body dementia. Right now there are no biomarkers to definitively diagnose Lewy body dementia, but some biomarkers support it. Biomarkers alone, without symptoms, aren&apos;t enough for a diagnosis. Biomarker tests to support Lewy body dementia diagnosis include: - Nuclear imaging tests such as single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) - Tests that measure check nerve function of the heart&apos;s blood vessels (iodine-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy) - Sleep studies that examine brain wave activity Your doctor may also diagnose Lewy body dementia based on the presence of one core symptom and one or more of these biomarkers that support the diagnosis: - Autonomic dysfunction, which involves instability in blood pressure and heart rate, poor regulation of body temperature, sweating, and related symptoms - Feeling excessively sleepy during the daytime - Loss of the sense of smell There are several combinations of symptoms, features and biomarkers that help doctors diagnose Lewy body dementia. Depending on the combination, the diagnosis may be considered probable or possible. Doctors may also try to rule out other conditions that may cause similar signs and symptoms to support a diagnosis of Lewy body dementia. Tests may include: Neurological and physical examination Your doctor may check for signs of Parkinson&apos;s disease, strokes, tumors or other medical conditions that can affect the brain and physical function. The neurological examination may test: - Reflexes - Strength - Walking - Muscle tone - Eye movements - Balance - Sense of touch Assessment of mental abilities A short form of this test, which assesses your memory and thinking skills, can be done in less than 10 minutes in your doctor&apos;s office. It&apos;s not generally useful in distinguishing Lewy body dementia from Alzheimer&apos;s disease but can indicate dementia. Longer tests can take several hours, but help identify Lewy body dementia. Your doctor will compare your test results with those of people from a similar age and education level. This can help distinguish normal from abnormal cognitive aging, and may help diagnose the condition. Blood tests These can rule out physical problems that can affect brain function, such as vitamin B-12 deficiency or an underactive thyroid gland. Brain scans Your doctor may order an MRI, PET or CT scan to identify a stroke or bleeding, and to rule out the possibility of a tumor. While dementias are diagnosed based on the history and physical examination, certain features on imaging studies can suggest different types of dementia, such as Alzheimer&apos;s or Lewy body dementia. Your doctor may order a sleep evaluation to check for REM sleep behavior disorder or an autonomic function test to look for signs of heart rate and blood pressure instability.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Frontotemporal dementia (Diagnosis): No single test can identify frontotemporal dementia, so doctors attempt to identify certain characteristic features while excluding other possible causes. The disorder can be especially challenging to diagnose in the early stages, as symptoms of frontotemporal dementia often overlap with those of other conditions. Blood tests To see if your symptoms are being caused by a different condition, such as liver or kidney disease, your doctor may order blood tests. Neuropsychological testing Sometimes doctors undertake a more extensive assessment of reasoning and memory skills. This type of testing is especially helpful in determining the type of dementia at an early stage. Brain scans By looking at images of the brain, doctors may be able to pinpoint any visible abnormalities - such as clots, bleeding or tumors - that may be causing signs and symptoms. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI machine uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to produce detailed images of your brain. - Positron emission tomography (PET). PET scans use a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that&apos;s injected into a vein to help visualize blood sugar metabolism in the brain, which can help identify frontal or temporal lobe brain abnormalities.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Vascular dementia (Diagnosis): Doctors can nearly always determine that you have dementia, but there&apos;s no specific test that confirms you have vascular dementia. Your doctor will make a judgment about whether vascular dementia is the most likely cause of your symptoms based on the information you provide, your medical history for stroke or disorders of the heart and blood vessels, and results of tests that may help clarify your diagnosis. Lab tests If your medical record doesn&apos;t include recent values for key indicators of the health of your heart and blood vessels, your doctor will test your: - Blood pressure - Cholesterol - Blood sugar He or she may also order tests to rule out other potential causes of memory loss and confusion, such as: - Thyroid disorders - Vitamin deficiencies Neurological exam Your doctor is likely to check your overall neurological health by testing your: - Reflexes - Muscle tone and strength, and how strength on one side of your body compares with the other side - Ability to get up from a chair and walk across the room - Sense of touch and sight - Coordination - Balance Brain imaging Images of your brain can pinpoint visible abnormalities caused by strokes, blood vessel diseases, tumors or trauma that may cause changes in thinking and reasoning. A brain-imaging study can help your doctor zero in on more likely causes for your symptoms and rule out other causes. Brain-imaging procedures your doctor may recommend to help diagnose vascular dementia include: - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. For a CT scan, you&apos;ll lie on a narrow table that slides into a small chamber. X-rays pass through your body from various angles, and a computer uses this information to create detailed cross-sectional images (slices) of your brain. This test is painless and takes about 20 minutes. A CT scan can provide information about your brain&apos;s structure; tell whether any regions show shrinkage; and detect evidence of strokes, mini strokes (transient ischemic attacks), blood vessel changes or tumors. Sometimes you&apos;ll receive an intravenous (IV) injection of a contrast agent that will help highlight certain brain tissues. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to produce detailed images of your brain. You lie on a narrow table that slides into a tube-shaped MRI machine, which makes loud banging noises while it produces images. The entire procedure can take an hour or more. MRIs are painless, but some people feel claustrophobic inside the machine and are disturbed by the noise. MRIs can provide even more detail than CT scans about strokes, mini strokes and blood vessel abnormalities. Carotid ultrasound This procedure uses high-frequency sound waves to determine whether your carotid arteries - which run up through either side of your neck to supply blood to brain - show signs of narrowing as a result of plaque deposits or structural problems. Your test may include a Doppler ultrasound, which shows the movement of blood through your arteries in addition to structural features. Neuropsychological tests This type of exam assesses your ability to: - Speak, write and understand language - Work with numbers - Learn and remember information - Develop a plan of attack and solve a problem - Respond effectively to hypothetical situations Neuropsychological tests sometimes show characteristic results for people with different types of dementia. People with vascular dementia may have an exceptionally hard time analyzing a problem and developing an effective solution. They may be less likely to have trouble learning new information and remembering than are people with Alzheimer&apos;s unless their blood vessel problems affect specific brain regions important for memory. However, there&apos;s often a lot of overlap in exam results for people with vascular dementia and people who have Alzheimer&apos;s disease.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>COPD: Español   Also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; chronic bronchitis; or emphysema. COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a progressive disease that makes it hard to breathe. Progressive means the disease gets worse over time. COPD can cause coughing that produces large amounts of a slimy substance called mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and other symptoms. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD. Most people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke. However, up to 25 percent of people with COPD never smoked. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants—such as air pollution, chemical fumes, or dusts—also may contribute to COPD. A rare genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency can also cause the disease. Overview To understand COPD, it helps to understand how the lungs work. The air that you breathe goes down your windpipe into tubes in your lungs called bronchial tubes or airways. Within the lungs, your bronchial tubes branch many times into thousands of smaller, thinner tubes called bronchioles. These tubes end in bunches of tiny round air sacs called alveoli. Small blood vessels called capillaries run along the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, a waste product, called carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, moves from the capillaries into the air sacs. This process, called gas exchange, brings in oxygen for the body to use for vital functions and removes the CO2. The airways and air sacs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate and the air goes out. In COPD, less air flows in and out of the airways because of one or more of the following: The airways and air sacs lose their elastic quality. The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed. The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed. The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged. Normal Lungs and Lungs With COPD In the United States, the term COPD includes two main conditions—emphysema and chronic bronchitis. In emphysema, the walls between many of the air sacs are damaged. As a result, the air sacs lose their shape and become floppy. This damage also can destroy the walls of the air sacs, leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. If this happens, the amount of gas exchange in the lungs is reduced. In chronic bronchitis, the lining of the airways stays constantly irritated and inflamed, and this causes the lining to swell. Lots of thick mucus forms in the airways, making it hard to breathe. Most people who have COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but the severity of each condition varies from person to person. Thus, the general term COPD is more accurate. Outlook COPD is a major cause of disability, and it is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Currently, 16 million people are diagnosed with COPD. Many more people may have the disease and not even know it. COPD develops slowly. Symptoms often worsen over time and can limit your ability to do routine activities. Severe COPD may prevent you from doing even basic activities like walking, cooking, or taking care of yourself. Most of the time, COPD is diagnosed in middle-aged or older adults. The disease is not contagious, meaning it cannot be passed from person to person. COPD has no cure yet, and doctors do not know how to reverse the damage to the lungs. However, treatments and lifestyle changes can help you feel better, stay more active, and slow the progress of the disease.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What is COPD?: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is a progressive lung disease in which the airways of the lungs become damaged, making it hard to breathe. You may also have heard COPD called other names, like emphysema or chronic bronchitis. In people who have COPD, the airways that carry air in and out of the lungs are partially blocked, making it difficult to get air in and out. COPD is a major cause of death and illness throughout the world. It kills more than 120,000 Americans each year. That&apos;s one death every 4 minutes. How COPD Affects Airways The &quot;airways&quot; are the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs through the nose and mouth. The airways of the lungs branch out like an upside-down tree. At the end of each branch are many small, balloon-like air sacs. In healthy people, the airways and air sacs are elastic (stretchy). When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon, and when you breathe out, the balloon deflates and the air goes out. In people with COPD, the airways and air sacs lose their shape and become floppy. Less air gets in and less air goes out of the airways because - The airways and air sacs lose their elasticity like an old rubber band. - The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed. - The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed or swollen. - Cells in the airways make more mucus or sputum than usual, which tends to clog the airways.

Cells in the airways make more mucus or sputum than usual, which tends to clog the airways. COPD Develops Slowly, Has No Cure When COPD is severe, shortness of breath and other symptoms of COPD can get in the way of even the most basic tasks, such as doing light housework, taking a walk, even washing and dressing. COPD develops slowly, and it may be many years before you notice symptoms like feeling short of breath. Most of the time, COPD is diagnosed in middle-aged or older people. There is no cure for COPD. The damage to your airways and lungs cannot be reversed, but there are things you can do to control the disabling effects of the disease. COPD is not contagious. You cannot catch it from someone else.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. Symptoms include breathing difficulty, cough, mucus (sputum) production and wheezing. It&apos;s caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter, most often from cigarette smoke. People with COPD are at increased risk of developing heart disease, lung cancer and a variety of other conditions. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common conditions that contribute to COPD. Chronic bronchitis is inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, which carry air to and from the air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs. It&apos;s characterized by daily cough and mucus (sputum) production. Emphysema is a condition in which the alveoli at the end of the smallest air passages (bronchioles) of the lungs are destroyed as a result of damaging exposure to cigarette smoke and other irritating gases and particulate matter. COPD is treatable. With proper management, most people with COPD can achieve good symptom control and quality of life, as well as reduced risk of other associated conditions. COPD care at Mayo Clinic COPD symptoms often don&apos;t appear until significant lung damage has occurred, and they usually worsen over time, particularly if smoking exposure continues. For chronic bronchitis, the main symptom is a daily cough and mucus (sputum) production at least three months a year for two consecutive years. Other signs and symptoms of COPD may include: - Shortness of breath, especially during physical activities - Wheezing - Chest tightness - Having to clear your throat first thing in the morning, due to excess mucus in your lungs - A chronic cough that may produce mucus (sputum) that may be clear, white, yellow or greenish - Blueness of the lips or fingernail beds (cyanosis) - Frequent respiratory infections - Lack of energy - Unintended weight loss (in later stages) - Swelling in ankles, feet or legs People with COPD are also likely to experience episodes called exacerbations, during which their symptoms become worse than usual day-to-day variation and persist for at least several days. The main cause of COPD in developed countries is tobacco smoking. In the developing world, COPD often occurs in people exposed to fumes from burning fuel for cooking and heating in poorly ventilated homes. Only about 20 to 30 percent of chronic smokers may develop clinically apparent COPD, although many smokers with long smoking histories may develop reduced lung function. Some smokers develop less common lung conditions. They may be misdiagnosed as having COPD until a more thorough evaluation is performed. Air travels down your windpipe (trachea) and into your lungs through two large tubes (bronchi). Inside your lungs, these tubes divide many times - like the branches of a tree - into many smaller tubes (bronchioles) that end in clusters of tiny air sacs (alveoli). The air sacs have very thin walls full of tiny blood vessels (capillaries). The oxygen in the air you inhale passes into these blood vessels and enters your bloodstream. At the same time, carbon dioxide - a gas that is a waste product of metabolism - is exhaled. Your lungs rely on the natural elasticity of the bronchial tubes and air sacs to force air out of your body. COPD causes them to lose their elasticity and overexpand, which leaves some air trapped in your lungs when you exhale. Causes of airway obstruction include: - Emphysema. This lung disease causes destruction of the fragile walls and elastic fibers of the alveoli. Small airways collapse when you exhale, impairing airflow out of your lungs. - Chronic bronchitis. In this condition, your bronchial tubes become inflamed and narrowed and your lungs produce more mucus, which can further block the narrowed tubes. You develop a chronic cough trying to clear your airways. In the vast majority of cases, the lung damage that leads to COPD is caused by long-term cigarette smoking. But there are likely other factors at play in the development of COPD, such as a genetic susceptibility to the disease, because only about 20 to 30 percent of smokers may develop COPD. Other irritants can cause COPD, including cigar smoke, secondhand smoke, pipe smoke, air pollution and workplace exposure to dust, smoke or fumes. In about 1 percent of people with COPD, the disease results from a genetic disorder that causes low levels of a protein called alpha-1-antitrypsin. Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAt) is made in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream to help protect the lungs. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency can affect the liver as well as the lungs. Damage to the lung can occur in infants and children, not only adults with long smoking histories. For adults with COPD related to AAt deficiency, treatment options include those used for people with more-common types of COPD. In addition, some people can be treated by replacing the missing AAt protein, which may prevent further damage to the lungs. Risk factors for COPD include: - Exposure to tobacco smoke. The most significant risk factor for COPD is long-term cigarette smoking. The more years you smoke and the more packs you smoke, the greater your risk. Pipe smokers, cigar smokers and marijuana smokers also may be at risk, as well as people exposed to large amounts of secondhand smoke. - People with asthma who smoke. The combination of asthma, a chronic inflammatory airway disease, and smoking increases the risk of COPD even more. - Occupational exposure to dusts and chemicals. Long-term exposure to chemical fumes, vapors and dusts in the workplace can irritate and inflame your lungs. - Exposure to fumes from burning fuel. In the developing world, people exposed to fumes from burning fuel for cooking and heating in poorly ventilated homes are at higher risk of developing COPD. - Age. COPD develops slowly over years, so most people are at least 40 years old when symptoms begin. - Genetics. The uncommon genetic disorder alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the cause of some cases of COPD. Other genetic factors likely make certain smokers more susceptible to the disease. COPD can cause many complications, including: - Respiratory infections. People with COPD are more likely to catch colds, the flu and pneumonia. Any respiratory infection can make it much more difficult to breathe and could cause further damage to lung tissue. An annual flu vaccination and regular vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia can prevent some infections. - Heart problems. For reasons that aren&apos;t fully understood, COPD can increase your risk of heart disease, including heart attack. Quitting smoking may reduce this risk. - Lung cancer. People with COPD have a higher risk of developing lung cancer. Quitting smoking may reduce this risk. - High blood pressure in lung arteries. COPD may cause high blood pressure in the arteries that bring blood to your lungs (pulmonary hypertension). - Depression. Difficulty breathing can keep you from doing activities that you enjoy. And dealing with serious illness can contribute to development of depression. Talk to your doctor if you feel sad or helpless or think that you may be experiencing depression. COPD is commonly misdiagnosed - former smokers may sometimes be told they have COPD, when in reality they may have simple deconditioning or another less common lung condition. Likewise, many people who have COPD may not be diagnosed until the disease is advanced and interventions are less effective. To diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your signs and symptoms, discuss your family and medical history, and discuss any exposure you&apos;ve had to lung irritants - especially cigarette smoke. Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose your condition. Tests may include: - Lung (pulmonary) function tests. Pulmonary function tests measure the amount of air you can inhale and exhale, and if your lungs are delivering enough oxygen to your blood. Spirometry is the most common lung function test. During this test, you&apos;ll be asked to blow into a large tube connected to a small machine called a spirometer. This machine measures how much air your lungs can hold and how fast you can blow the air out of your lungs. Spirometry can detect COPD even before you have symptoms of the disease. It can also be used to track the progression of disease and to monitor how well treatment is working. Spirometry often includes measurement of the effect of bronchodilator administration. Other lung function tests include measurement of lung volumes, diffusing capacity and pulse oximetry. - Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show emphysema, one of the main causes of COPD. An X-ray can also rule out other lung problems or heart failure. - CT scan. A CT scan of your lungs can help detect emphysema and help determine if you might benefit from surgery for COPD. CT scans can also be used to screen for lung cancer. - Arterial blood gas analysis. This blood test measures how well your lungs are bringing oxygen into your blood and removing carbon dioxide. - Laboratory tests. Laboratory tests aren&apos;t used to diagnose COPD, but they may be used to determine the cause of your symptoms or rule out other conditions. For example, laboratory tests may be used to determine if you have the genetic disorder alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAt) deficiency, which may be the cause of some cases of COPD. This test may be done if you have a family history of COPD and develop COPD at a young age, such as under age 45. A diagnosis of COPD is not the end of the world. Most people have mild forms of the disease for which little therapy is needed other than smoking cessation. Even for more advanced stages of disease, effective therapy is available that can control symptoms, reduce your risk of complications and exacerbations, and improve your ability to lead an active life. Smoking cessation The most essential step in any treatment plan for COPD is to stop all smoking. It&apos;s the only way to keep COPD from getting worse - which can eventually reduce your ability to breathe. But quitting smoking isn&apos;t easy. And this task may seem particularly daunting if you&apos;ve tried to quit and have been unsuccessful. Talk to your doctor about nicotine replacement products and medications that might help, as well as how to handle relapses. Your doctor may also recommend a support group for people who want to quit smoking. It&apos;s also a good idea to avoid secondhand smoke exposure whenever possible. Medications Doctors use several kinds of medications to treat the symptoms and complications of COPD. You may take some medications on a regular basis and others as needed. These medications - which usually come in an inhaler - relax the muscles around your airways. This can help relieve coughing and shortness of breath and make breathing easier. Depending on the severity of your disease, you may need a short-acting bronchodilator before activities, a long-acting bronchodilator that you use every day or both. Short-acting bronchodilators include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others), levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA), and ipratropium (Atrovent). The long-acting bronchodilators include tiotropium (Spiriva), salmeterol (Serevent), formoterol (Foradil, Perforomist), arformoterol (Brovana), indacaterol (Arcapta) and aclidinium (Tudorza). Inhaled corticosteroid medications can reduce airway inflammation and help prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include bruising, oral infections and hoarseness. These medications are useful for people with frequent exacerbations of COPD. Fluticasone (Flovent HFA, Flonase, others) and budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler, Uceris, others) are examples of inhaled steroids. Some medications combine bronchodilators and inhaled steroids. Salmeterol and fluticasone (Advair) and formoterol and budesonide (Symbicort) are examples of combination inhalers. For people who have a moderate or severe acute exacerbation, short courses (for example, five days) of oral corticosteroids prevent further worsening of COPD. However, long-term use of these medications can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts and an increased risk of infection. A new type of medication approved for people with severe COPD and symptoms of chronic bronchitis is roflumilast (Daliresp), a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. This drug decreases airway inflammation and relaxes the airways. Common side effects include diarrhea and weight loss. This very inexpensive medication may help improve breathing and prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include nausea, headache, fast heartbeat and tremor. Side effects are dose related, and low doses are recommended. Respiratory infections, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and influenza, can aggravate COPD symptoms. Antibiotics help treat acute exacerbations, but they aren&apos;t generally recommended for prevention. However, a recent study shows that the antibiotic azithromycin prevents exacerbations, but it isn&apos;t clear whether this is due to its antibiotic effect or its anti-inflammatory properties. Lung therapies Doctors often use these additional therapies for people with moderate or severe COPD: - Oxygen therapy. If there isn&apos;t enough oxygen in your blood, you may need supplemental oxygen. There are several devices to deliver oxygen to your lungs, including lightweight, portable units that you can take with you to run errands and get around town. Some people with COPD use oxygen only during activities or while sleeping. Others use oxygen all the time. Oxygen therapy can improve quality of life and is the only COPD therapy proven to extend life. Talk to your doctor about your needs and options. - Pulmonary rehabilitation program. These programs generally combine education, exercise training, nutrition advice and counseling. You&apos;ll work with a variety of specialists, who can tailor your rehabilitation program to meet your needs. Pulmonary rehabilitation may shorten hospitalizations, increase your ability to participate in everyday activities and improve your quality of life. Talk to your doctor about referral to a program. Managing exacerbations Even with ongoing treatment, you may experience times when symptoms become worse for days or weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation, and it may lead to lung failure if you don&apos;t receive prompt treatment. Exacerbations may be caused by a respiratory infection, air pollution or other triggers of inflammation. Whatever the cause, it&apos;s important to seek prompt medical help if you notice a sustained increase in coughing, a change in your mucus or if you have a harder time breathing. When exacerbations occur, you may need additional medications (such as antibiotics, steroids or both), supplemental oxygen or treatment in the hospital. Once symptoms improve, your doctor will talk with you about measures to prevent future exacerbations, such as quitting smoking, taking inhaled steroids, long-acting bronchodilators or other medications, getting your annual flu vaccine, and avoiding air pollution whenever possible. Surgery Surgery is an option for some people with some forms of severe emphysema who aren&apos;t helped sufficiently by medications alone. Surgical options include: - Lung volume reduction surgery. In this surgery, your surgeon removes small wedges of damaged lung tissue from the upper lungs. This creates extra space in your chest cavity so that the remaining healthier lung tissue can expand and the diaphragm can work more efficiently. In some people, this surgery can improve quality of life and prolong survival. - Lung transplant. Lung transplantation may be an option for certain people who meet specific criteria. Transplantation can improve your ability to breathe and to be active. However, it&apos;s a major operation that has significant risks, such as organ rejection, and it&apos;s necessary to take lifelong immune-suppressing medications. - Bullectomy. Large air spaces (bullae) form in the lungs when the walls of the air sacs are destroyed. These bullae can become very large and cause breathing problems. In a bullectomy, doctors remove bullae from the lungs to help improve air flow. If you have COPD, you can take steps to feel better and slow the damage to your lungs: - Control your breathing. Talk to your doctor or respiratory therapist about techniques for breathing more efficiently throughout the day. Also be sure to discuss breathing positions and relaxation techniques that you can use when you&apos;re short of breath. - Clear your airways. With COPD, mucus tends to collect in your air passages and can be difficult to clear. Controlled coughing, drinking plenty of water and using a humidifier may help. - Exercise regularly. It may seem difficult to exercise when you have trouble breathing, but regular exercise can improve your overall strength and endurance and strengthen your respiratory muscles. Discuss with your doctor which activities are appropriate for you. - Eat healthy foods. A healthy diet can help you maintain your strength. If you&apos;re underweight, your doctor may recommend nutritional supplements. If you&apos;re overweight, losing weight can significantly help your breathing, especially during times of exertion. - Avoid smoke and air pollution. In addition to quitting smoking, it&apos;s important to avoid places where others smoke. Secondhand smoke may contribute to further lung damage. Other types of air pollution also can irritate your lungs. - See your doctor regularly. Stick to your appointment schedule, even if you&apos;re feeling fine. It&apos;s important to steadily monitor your lung function. And be sure to get your annual flu vaccine in the fall to help prevent infections that can worsen your COPD. Ask your doctor when you need the pneumococcal vaccine. Let your doctor know if you have worsening symptoms or you notice signs of infection.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Smoking and COPD: Smoking is the leading cause of COPD. Smoking is also a trigger for COPD flare-ups. Smoking damages the air sacs, airways, and the lining of your lungs. Injured lungs have trouble moving enough air in and out, so it&apos;s hard to breathe. Things that make chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) symptoms worse are called triggers. Knowing what your triggers are and how to avoid them can help you feel better. Smoking is a trigger for many people who have COPD. Smoking can cause an exacerbation, or flare-up, of your symptoms. You do not have to be a smoker for smoking to cause harm. Exposure to someone else&apos;s smoking (called secondhand smoke) is also a trigger for COPD flare-ups. Smoking damages your lungs. When you have COPD and smoke, your lungs will get damaged more rapidly than if you were to stop smoking. Quitting smoking is the best thing you can do to protect your lungs and keep your COPD symptoms from getting worse. This can help you stay more active and enjoy life. Tell your friends and family about your goal to quit. Take a break from people and situations that make you want to smoke. Keep busy with other things. Take it 1 day at a time. Ask your health care provider to help you quit. There are many ways to quit smoking, including: - Medicines - Nicotine replacement therapy - Support groups, counseling, or stop-smoking classes in person or online It is not easy, but anyone can quit. Newer medicines and programs can be very helpful. List the reasons you want to quit. Then set a quit date. You may need to try quitting more than once. And that&apos;s OK. Keep trying if you do not succeed at first. The more times you try to quit, the more likely you are to be successful. Secondhand smoke will trigger more COPD flare-ups and cause more damage to your lungs. So you need to take steps to avoid secondhand smoke. - Make your home and car smoke-free zones. Tell others you are with to follow this rule. Take ashtrays out of your home. - Choose smoke-free restaurants, bars, and workplaces (if possible). - Avoid public places that allow smoking. Setting these rules can: - Reduce the amount of secondhand smoke you and your family breathe in - Help you quit smoking and stay smoke-free If there are smokers at your workplace, ask someone about policies regarding if and where smoking is allowed. Tips to help with secondhand smoke at work are: - Make sure there are proper containers for smokers to throw away their cigarette butts and matches. - Ask coworkers who smoke to keep their coats away from work areas. - Use a fan and keep windows open, if possible. - Use an alternative exit to avoid smokers outside the building.

				<AnswerText>What is COPD?: COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) makes it hard for you to breathe. The two main types are chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The main cause of COPD is long-term exposure to substances that irritate and damage the lungs. This is usually cigarette smoke. Air pollution, chemical fumes, or dust can also cause it. At first, COPD may cause no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, symptoms usually become more severe. They include - A cough that produces a lot of mucus - Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity - Wheezing - Chest tightness Doctors use lung function tests, imaging tests, and blood tests to diagnose COPD. There is no cure. Treatments may relieve symptoms. They include medicines, oxygen therapy, surgery, or a lung transplant. Quitting smoking is the most important step you can take to treat COPD.

				<AnswerText>COPD and other health problems: If you have COPD, you are more likely to have other health problems, too. These are called comorbidities. People with COPD tend to have more health problems than people who do not have COPD. Having other health problems can affect your symptoms and treatments. You may need to visit your doctor more often. You also may need to have more tests or treatments. Having COPD is a lot to manage. But try to stay positive. You can protect your health by understanding why you are at risk for certain conditions and learning how to prevent them. If you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), you are more likely to have: - Repeat infections, such as pneumonia. COPD increases your risk of complications from colds and the flu. It increases your risk of needing to be hospitalized due to lung infection. - High blood pressure in the lungs. COPD may cause high blood pressure in the arteries that bring blood to your lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension. - Heart disease. COPD increases your risk of heart attack, heart failure, chest pain, irregular heartbeat, and blood clots. - Diabetes. Having COPD increases this risk. Also, some COPD medicines can cause high blood sugar. - Osteoporosis (weak bones). People with COPD often have low levels of vitamin D, are inactive, and smoke. These factors increase your risk of bone loss and weak bones. Certain COPD medicines also may cause bone loss. - Depression and anxiety. It is common for people with COPD to feel depressed or anxious. Being breathless can cause anxiety. Plus, having symptoms slows you down so you can&apos;t do as much as you used to. - Heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD and heartburn can lead to more COPD symptoms and flare-ups. - Lung cancer. Continuing to smoke increases this risk. Many factors play a role in why people with COPD often have other health problems. Smoking is one of the biggest culprits. Smoking is a risk factor for most of the problems above. - COPD usually develops in middle age. And people tend to have more health problems as they age. - COPD makes it hard to breathe, which can make it hard to get enough exercise. Being inactive can lead to bone and muscle loss and increase your risk for other health problems. - Certain COPD medicines can increase your risk of other conditions such as bone loss, heart conditions, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Work closely with your doctor to keep COPD and other medical problems under control. Taking the following steps can also help protect your health: - Take medicines and treatments as directed. - If you smoke, quit. Also avoid secondhand smoke. Avoiding smoke is the best way to slow down damage to your lungs. Ask your doctor about stop-smoking programs and other options, such as nicotine replacement therapy and tobacco cessation medicines. - Discuss the risks and side effects of your medicines with your doctor. There may be better options available or things you can do to reduce or offset the harms. Tell your doctor if you notice any side effects. - Have a yearly flu vaccine and a pneumonia vaccine to help guard against infections. Wash your hands often. Stay away from people with colds or other infections. - Stay as active as possible. Try short walks and light weight training. Talk with your doctor about ways to get exercise. - Eat a healthy diet rich in lean proteins, fish, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Eating several small healthy meals a day can give you the nutrients you need without feeling bloated. An overfull belly can make it hard to breathe. - Talk with your doctor if you feel sad, helpless, or worried. There are programs and medicines that can help you feel more positive and hopeful. Remember that you are not alone. Your doctor will work with you to help you stay as healthy and active as possible. You should call your doctor when: - You have new signs or symptoms that concern you. - You are having trouble managing one or more of your health conditions. - You have concerns about your health problems and treatments. - You feel hopeless, sad, or anxious. - You notice medicine side effects that bother you.

				<AnswerText>COPD - how to use a nebulizer: A nebulizer turns your COPD medicine into a mist. It is easier to breathe the medicine into your lungs this way. If you use a nebulizer, your COPD medicines will come in liquid form. With a nebulizer, you will sit with your machine and use a mouthpiece. Medicine goes into your lungs as you take slow, deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes. Many people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) do not need to use a nebulizer. Another way to get your medicine is with an inhaler, which is usually just as effective. Nebulizers can deliver medicine with less effort than inhalers. You and your doctor can decide if a nebulizer is the best way to get the medicine you need. The choice of device may be based on whether you find a nebulizer easier to use and what type of medicine you take. Most nebulizers use air compressors. Some use sound vibrations. These are called &quot;ultrasonic nebulizers.&quot; They are quieter, but they cost more. Follow these steps to set up and use your nebulizer: - Connect the hose to the air compressor. - Fill the medicine cup with your prescription. To avoid spills, close the medicine cup tightly and always hold the mouthpiece straight up and down. - Attach the other end of the hose to the mouthpiece and medicine cup. - Turn on the nebulizer machine. - Place the mouthpiece in your mouth. Keep your lips firm around the mouthpiece so that all of the medicine goes into your lungs. - Breathe through your mouth until all the medicine is used. This usually takes 10 to 15 minutes. Some people use a nose clip to help them breathe only through their mouth. - Turn off the machine when you are done. You will need to clean your nebulizer to prevent bacteria from growing in it, since bacteria can cause a lung infection. It takes some time to clean your nebulizer and keep it working properly. Be sure to unplug the machine before cleaning. After each use: - Wash the medicine cup and mouthpiece with warm running water. - Let them air dry on clean paper towels. - Later, hook up the nebulizer and run air through the machine for 20 seconds to make sure all of the parts are dry. - Take apart and store the machine in a covered area until the next use. Once per day, you may add a mild dish soap to the cleaning routine above. Once or twice each week: - You may add a soaking step to the cleaning routine above. - Soak the cup and mouthpiece in 1 part distilled white vinegar, 2 parts warm water solution. You may clean the outside of your machine with a warm, damp cloth as necessary. Never wash the hose or tubing. You will also need to change the filter. The instructions that come with your nebulizer will tell you when you should change the filter. Most nebulizers are small, so they are easy to transport. You may carry your nebulizer in your carry-on luggage when traveling by plane. - Keep your nebulizer covered and packed in a safe place. - Pack your medicines in a cool, dry place when traveling. Call your doctor if you are having trouble using your nebulizer. You should also call if you have any of these problems while using your nebulizer: - Anxiety - Feeling that your heart is racing or pounding (palpitations) - Shortness of breath - Feeling very excited These may be signs that you are getting too much medicine.

				<AnswerText>COPD - managing stress and your mood (How Your Emotions can Affect COPD): Having COPD can change how you feel about yourself. And how you feel about yourself can affect COPD symptoms and how well you care for yourself. People with COPD who are depressed may have more COPD flare-ups and may have to go to the hospital more often. Depression saps your energy and motivation. When you are depressed, you may be less likely to: - Eat well and exercise. - Take your medicines as directed. - Follow your treatment plan. - Get enough rest. Or, you may get too much rest. Stress is a known COPD trigger. When you feel stressed and anxious, you may breathe faster, which can make you feel short of breath. When it is harder to breathe, you feel more anxious, and the cycle continues, leading you to feel even worse.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>COPD (Causes): Long-term exposure to lung irritants that damage the lungs and the airways usually is the cause of COPD. In the United States, the most common irritant that causes COPD is cigarette smoke. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke also can cause COPD, especially if the smoke is inhaled. Breathing in secondhand smoke, which is in the air from other people smoking; air pollution; or chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace also can contribute to COPD. Rarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency may play a role in causing COPD. People who have this condition have low blood levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT)—a protein made in the liver. Having a low level of the AAT protein can lead to lung damage and COPD if you are exposed to smoke or other lung irritants. If you have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and also smoke, COPD can worsen very quickly. Some people who have asthma can develop COPD. Asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. Treatment usually can reverse the inflammation and narrowing that occurs in asthma. </AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>COPD (Prevention): You can take steps to prevent COPD before it starts. If you already have COPD, you can take steps to prevent complications and slow the progression of the disease. Prevent COPD Before It Starts The best way to prevent COPD is to not start smoking or to quit smoking. Smoking is the leading cause of COPD. If you smoke, talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. Ask your family members and friends to support you in your efforts to quit. Also, try to avoid lung irritants that can contribute to COPD, such as air pollution, chemical fumes, dusts, and secondhand smoke, which is smoke in the air from other people smoking. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&apos;s Your Guide to a Healthy Heart. Although these resources focus on heart health, they include basic information about how to quit smoking. For free help and support to quit smoking, you may call the National Cancer Institute’s Smoking Quitline at 1-877-44U-QUIT (1-877-448-7848). Prevent Complications and Slow the Progression of COPD If you have COPD, the most important step you can take is to quit smoking. Quitting can help prevent complications and slow the progression of the disease. You also should avoid exposure to the lung irritants mentioned above. Follow your treatments for COPD exactly as your doctor prescribes. They can help you breathe easier, stay more active, and avoid or manage severe symptoms. Talk with your doctor about whether and when you should get flu, or influenza, and pneumonia vaccines. These vaccines can lower your chances of getting these illnesses, which are major health risks for people who have COPD.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>COPD: Español   Also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; chronic bronchitis; or emphysema. COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a progressive disease that makes it hard to breathe. Progressive means the disease gets worse over time. COPD can cause coughing that produces large amounts of a slimy substance called mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and other symptoms. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD. Most people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke. However, up to 25 percent of people with COPD never smoked. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants—such as air pollution, chemical fumes, or dusts—also may contribute to COPD. A rare genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency can also cause the disease. Overview To understand COPD, it helps to understand how the lungs work. The air that you breathe goes down your windpipe into tubes in your lungs called bronchial tubes or airways. Within the lungs, your bronchial tubes branch many times into thousands of smaller, thinner tubes called bronchioles. These tubes end in bunches of tiny round air sacs called alveoli. Small blood vessels called capillaries run along the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, a waste product, called carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, moves from the capillaries into the air sacs. This process, called gas exchange, brings in oxygen for the body to use for vital functions and removes the CO2. The airways and air sacs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate and the air goes out. In COPD, less air flows in and out of the airways because of one or more of the following: The airways and air sacs lose their elastic quality. The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed. The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed. The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged. Normal Lungs and Lungs With COPD In the United States, the term COPD includes two main conditions—emphysema and chronic bronchitis. In emphysema, the walls between many of the air sacs are damaged. As a result, the air sacs lose their shape and become floppy. This damage also can destroy the walls of the air sacs, leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. If this happens, the amount of gas exchange in the lungs is reduced. In chronic bronchitis, the lining of the airways stays constantly irritated and inflamed, and this causes the lining to swell. Lots of thick mucus forms in the airways, making it hard to breathe. Most people who have COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but the severity of each condition varies from person to person. Thus, the general term COPD is more accurate. Outlook COPD is a major cause of disability, and it is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Currently, 16 million people are diagnosed with COPD. Many more people may have the disease and not even know it. COPD develops slowly. Symptoms often worsen over time and can limit your ability to do routine activities. Severe COPD may prevent you from doing even basic activities like walking, cooking, or taking care of yourself. Most of the time, COPD is diagnosed in middle-aged or older adults. The disease is not contagious, meaning it cannot be passed from person to person. COPD has no cure yet, and doctors do not know how to reverse the damage to the lungs. However, treatments and lifestyle changes can help you feel better, stay more active, and slow the progress of the disease.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>COPD (Signs and Symptoms): At first, COPD may cause no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, symptoms usually become more severe. Common signs and symptoms of COPD include: An ongoing cough or a cough that produces a lot of mucus; this is often called smoker&apos;s cough. Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity Wheezing or a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe Chest tightness If you have COPD, you also may often have colds or other respiratory infections such as the flu, or influenza. Not everyone who has the symptoms described above has COPD. Likewise, not everyone who has COPD has these symptoms. Some of the symptoms of COPD are similar to the symptoms of other diseases and conditions. Your doctor can determine if you have COPD. If your symptoms are mild, you may not notice them, or you may adjust your lifestyle to make breathing easier. For example, you may take the elevator instead of the stairs. Over time, symptoms may become severe enough to cause you to see a doctor. For example, you may become short of breath during physical exertion. The severity of your symptoms will depend on how much lung damage you have. If you keep smoking, the damage will occur faster than if you stop smoking. Severe COPD can cause other symptoms, such as swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs; weight loss; and lower muscle endurance. Some severe symptoms may require treatment in a hospital. You—or, if you are unable, family members or friends—should seek emergency care if you are experiencing the following: You are having a hard time catching your breath or talking. Your lips or fingernails turn blue or gray, a sign of a low oxygen level in your blood. People around you notice that you are not mentally alert. Your heartbeat is very fast.

				<AnswerText>COPD (Diagnosis): COPD is commonly misdiagnosed - former smokers may sometimes be told they have COPD, when in reality they may have simple deconditioning or another less common lung condition. Likewise, many people who have COPD may not be diagnosed until the disease is advanced and interventions are less effective. To diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your signs and symptoms, discuss your family and medical history, and discuss any exposure you&apos;ve had to lung irritants - especially cigarette smoke. Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose your condition. Tests may include: - Lung (pulmonary) function tests. Pulmonary function tests measure the amount of air you can inhale and exhale, and if your lungs are delivering enough oxygen to your blood. Spirometry is the most common lung function test. During this test, you&apos;ll be asked to blow into a large tube connected to a small machine called a spirometer. This machine measures how much air your lungs can hold and how fast you can blow the air out of your lungs. Spirometry can detect COPD even before you have symptoms of the disease. It can also be used to track the progression of disease and to monitor how well treatment is working. Spirometry often includes measurement of the effect of bronchodilator administration. Other lung function tests include measurement of lung volumes, diffusing capacity and pulse oximetry. - Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show emphysema, one of the main causes of COPD. An X-ray can also rule out other lung problems or heart failure. - CT scan. A CT scan of your lungs can help detect emphysema and help determine if you might benefit from surgery for COPD. CT scans can also be used to screen for lung cancer. - Arterial blood gas analysis. This blood test measures how well your lungs are bringing oxygen into your blood and removing carbon dioxide. - Laboratory tests. Laboratory tests aren&apos;t used to diagnose COPD, but they may be used to determine the cause of your symptoms or rule out other conditions. For example, laboratory tests may be used to determine if you have the genetic disorder alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAt) deficiency, which may be the cause of some cases of COPD. This test may be done if you have a family history of COPD and develop COPD at a young age, such as under age 45.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>COPD (Overview): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. Symptoms include breathing difficulty, cough, mucus (sputum) production and wheezing. It&apos;s caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter, most often from cigarette smoke. People with COPD are at increased risk of developing heart disease, lung cancer and a variety of other conditions. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common conditions that contribute to COPD. Chronic bronchitis is inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, which carry air to and from the air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs. It&apos;s characterized by daily cough and mucus (sputum) production. Emphysema is a condition in which the alveoli at the end of the smallest air passages (bronchioles) of the lungs are destroyed as a result of damaging exposure to cigarette smoke and other irritating gases and particulate matter. COPD is treatable. With proper management, most people with COPD can achieve good symptom control and quality of life, as well as reduced risk of other associated conditions.

				<AnswerText>What are the symptoms of COPD?: Common Symptoms The most common symptoms of COPD are - a cough that does not go away - coughing up lots of sputum (mucus). a cough that does not go away coughing up lots of sputum (mucus). These symptoms often start years before the flow of air in and out of the lungs is reduced. Not everyone who has a cough and sputum goes on to develop COPD. Other common symptoms of COPD include - shortness of breath while doing activities you used to be able to do - wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe) - tightness in the chest. shortness of breath while doing activities you used to be able to do wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe) tightness in the chest. Getting a Diagnosis Your doctor will diagnose COPD based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and test results. If your doctor thinks you may have COPD, he or she will examine you, listen to your lungs, and ask you questions about your medical history, and what lung irritants you may have been around for long periods of time. The Spirometry Test To confirm a diagnosis of COPD, your doctor will use a breathing test called spirometry. The test is easy and painless and shows how much air you can breathe out and measures how fast you can breathe it out. In a spirometry test, you breathe hard into a large hose connected to a machine called a spirometer. When you breathe out, the spirometer measures how much air your lungs can hold and how fast you can blow air out of your lungs. Spirometry can detect COPD before symptoms develop. Your doctor also might use the test results to find out how severe your COPD is and to help set your treatment goals. The test results also may help find out whether another condition, such as asthma or heart failure, is causing your symptoms. Determining COPD Severity Based on this test, your doctor can determine if you have COPD and how severe it is. There are four levels of severity for COPD: - people at risk for COPD - people with mild COPD - people with moderate COPD - people with severe COPD. people at risk for COPD people with mild COPD people with moderate COPD people with severe COPD. People at risk for developing COPD have a normal breathing test and mild symptoms such as chronic cough and sputum (mucus) production. People with mild COPD have mild breathing limitation. Symptoms may include a chronic cough and sputum (mucus) production. At this stage, you may not be aware that airflow in your lungs is reduced. People with moderate COPD have a breathing test that shows worsening airflow blockages. Symptoms may be worse than with mild COPD and you may experience shortness of breath while working hard, walking fast, or doing brisk activity. At this stage, you would seek medical attention. People with severe COPD have a breathing test that shows severe limitation of the airflow. People with severe COPD will be short of breath after just a little activity. In very severe COPD, complications like respiratory failure or signs of heart failure may develop. At this stage, quality of life is impaired and worsening symptoms may be life-threatening. Other Tests Other tests are used to rule out other causes of the symptoms. - Bronchodilator reversibility testing uses the spirometer and medications called bronchodilators to assess whether breathing problems may be caused by asthma. Bronchodilator reversibility testing uses the spirometer and medications called bronchodilators to assess whether breathing problems may be caused by asthma. - A chest X-ray or a chest CT scan may also be ordered by your doctor.

				<AnswerText>What are the symptoms of COPD?: Call your doctor right away if your symptoms worsen suddenly. People with COPD may have symptoms that suddenly get worse. When this happens, you have a much harder time catching your breath. Symptoms that worsen suddenly can include sudden chest tightness, more coughing, a change in your sputum (mucus), or fever. Your doctor will look at things that may be causing these sudden symptoms. Sometimes the symptoms are caused by a lung infection.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Vital signs: Vital signs reflect essential body functions, including your heartbeat, breathing rate, temperature, and blood pressure. Your health care provider may watch, measure, or monitor your vital signs to check your level of physical functioning. Normal vital signs change with age, sex, weight, exercise capability, and overall health. Normal vital sign ranges for the average healthy adult while resting are: - Blood pressure: 90/60 mm Hg to 120/80 mm Hg - Breathing: 12 to 18 breaths per minute - Pulse: 60 to 100 beats per minute - Temperature: 97.8°F to 99.1°F (36.5°C to 37.3°C)/average 98.6°F (37°C) Updated by: Linda J.

				<AnswerText>Myopathy with extrapyramidal signs: Myopathy with extrapyramidal signs is a disorder characterized by early childhood onset of proximal muscle weakness (muscles closest to the body’s midline) and learning disabilities. The muscle weakness does not progress, but most patients develop progressive atypical involuntary muscle contractions that influence gait, movement, and posture (extrapyramidal signs) that may be disabling. Signs and symptoms are variable and include brief, repetitive, jerky and uncontrolled movements caused by muscle contractions ( chorea), tremor, abnormal posturing, and involuntary repetitive movements of the mouth and face. [1]  Other symptoms may include uncoordinated movements ( ataxia ), a very small head ( microcephaly ), drooping of the eyelids, wasting of the eye nerve ( optic atrophy), and axonal peripheral neuropathy. It is caused by changes ( mutations ) in the MICU1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive   pattern. [1] [2] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below.

				<AnswerText>Warning signs and symptoms of heart disease: Heart disease often develops over time. You may have early signs or symptoms long before you have serious heart problems. Or you may not realize you are developing heart disease. The warning signs of heart disease may not be obvious. Also, not every person has the same symptoms. Certain symptoms, such as chest pain, ankle swelling, and shortness of breath may be signals that something is wrong. Learning the warning signs can help you get treatment and help prevent a heart attack or stroke. Chest pain is discomfort or pain that you feel along the front of your body, between your neck and upper abdomen. There are many causes of chest pain that have nothing to do with your heart. But chest pain is still the most common symptom of poor blood flow to the heart or a heart attack. This type of chest pain is called angina. Chest pain can occur when the heart is not getting enough blood or oxygen. The amount and type of pain can vary from person to person. The intensity of the pain does not always relate to how severe the problem is. - Some people may feel a crushing pain, while others feel only mild discomfort. - Your chest may feel heavy or like someone is squeezing your heart. You may also feel a sharp, burning pain in your chest. - You may feel the pain under your breastbone (sternum), or in your neck, arms, stomach, jaw, or upper back. - Chest pain from angina often occurs with activity or emotion, and goes away with rest or a medicine called nitroglycerin. - Bad indigestion can also cause chest pain. Women, older adults, and people with diabetes may have little or no chest pain. They are more likely to have symptoms other than chest pain, such as: - Fatigue - Shortness of breath - General weakness - Change in skin color or greyish pallor (episodes of change in skin color associated with weakness) Other symptoms of a heart attack can include: - Extreme anxiety - Fainting or loss of consciousness - Lightheadedness or dizziness - Nausea or vomiting - Palpitations (feeling like your heart is beating too fast or irregularly) - Shortness of breath - Sweating, which may be very heavy When the heart can&apos;t pump blood as well as it should, blood backs up in the veins that go from the lungs to the heart. Fluid leaks into the lungs and causes shortness of breath. This is a symptom of heart failure. You may notice shortness of breath: - During activity - While you&apos;re resting - When you&apos;re lying flat on your back -- it may even wake you from sleep Coughing or wheezing that doesn&apos;t go away can be another sign that fluid is building up in your lungs. You may also cough up mucus that is pink or bloody. Swelling (edema) in your lower legs is another sign of a heart problem. When your heart doesn&apos;t work as well, blood flow slows and backs up in the veins in your legs. This causes fluid to build up in your tissues. You may also have swelling in your stomach or notice some weight gain. Narrowing of the blood vessels that bring blood to other parts of the body may mean you have a much higher risk for heart attack. It can occur when cholesterol and other fatty material (plaque) build up on the walls of your arteries. Poor blood supply to the legs may lead to: - Pain, achiness, fatigue, burning, or discomfort in the muscles of your feet, calves, or thighs. - Symptoms that often appear during walking or exercise, and go away after several minutes of rest. - Numbness in your legs or feet when you are at rest. Your legs may also feel cool to the touch, and the skin may look pale. A stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain stops. A stroke is sometimes called a &quot;brain attack.&quot; Symptoms of stroke can include difficulty moving the limbs on one side of your body, one side of the face drooping, difficulty with speaking or understanding language. Tiredness can have many causes. Often it simply means that you need more rest. But feeling run down can be a sign of a more serious problem. Fatigue may be a sign of heart trouble when: - You feel much more tired than normal. It&apos;s common for women to feel severely tired before or during a heart attack. - You feel so tired that you can&apos;t do your normal daily activities. - You have sudden, severe weakness. If your heart can&apos;t pump blood as well, it may beat faster to try to keep up. You may feel your heart racing or throbbing. A fast or uneven heartbeat can also be the sign of an arrhythmia. This is a problem with your heart rate or rhythm. If you have any signs of heart disease, call your health care provider right away. Don&apos;t wait to see if the symptoms go away or dismiss them as nothing. Call your local emergency number (such as 911) if: - You have chest pain or other symptoms of a heart attack - If you know you have angina and have chest pain that doesn&apos;t go away after 5 minutes of rest or after taking nitroglycerine - If you think you may be having a heart attack - If you become extremely short of breath - If you think you may have lost consciousness Updated by: Michael A.

				<AnswerText>COPD (Diagnosis): Your doctor will diagnose COPD based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and test results. Your doctor may ask whether you smoke or have had contact with lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, or dusts. If you have an ongoing cough, let your doctor know how long you&apos;ve had it, how much you cough, and how much mucus comes up when you cough. Also, let your doctor know whether you have a family history of COPD. Your doctor will examine you and use a stethoscope to listen for wheezing or other abnormal chest sounds. He or she also may recommend one or more tests to diagnose COPD. Pulmonary Function Tests Pulmonary function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. The main test for COPD is spirometry. Other lung function tests, such as a lung diffusion capacity test, also might be used. Read Pulmonary Function Tests for more information. Spirometry During this painless test, a technician will ask you to take a deep breath in. Then, you&apos;ll blow as hard as you can into a tube connected to a small machine. The machine is called a spirometer. The machine measures how much air you breathe out. It also measures how fast you can blow air out. Spirometry Your doctor may have you inhale, or breathe in, medicine that helps open your airways and then blow into the tube again. He or she can then compare your test results before and after taking the medicine. Spirometry can detect COPD before symptoms develop. Your doctor also might use the test results to find out how severe your COPD is and to help set your treatment goals. The test results also may help find out whether another condition, such as asthma or heart failure, is causing your symptoms. Other Tests Your doctor may recommend other tests, such as: A chest x ray or chest CT scan. These tests create pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. The pictures can show signs of COPD. They also may show whether another condition, such as heart failure, is causing your symptoms. An arterial blood gas test. This blood test measures the oxygen level in your blood using a sample of blood taken from an artery. The results from this test can show how severe your COPD is and whether you need oxygen therapy.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>COPD (Treatment): COPD has no cure yet. However, lifestyle changes and treatments can help you feel better, stay more active, and slow the progress of the disease. The goals of COPD treatment include: Relieving your symptoms Slowing the progress of the disease Improving your exercise tolerance or your ability to stay active Preventing and treating complications Improving your overall health To assist with your treatment, your family doctor may advise you to see a pulmonologist. This is a doctor who specializes in treating lung disorders. Lifestyle Changes Quit Smoking and Avoid Lung Irritants Quitting smoking is the most important step you can take to treat COPD. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. Ask your family members and friends to support you in your efforts to quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke and places with dusts, fumes, or other toxic substances that you may inhale. For more information about how to quit smoking, read Smoking and Your Heart and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&apos;s Your Guide to a Healthy Heart. Although these resources focus on heart health, they include basic information about how to quit smoking. For free help and support to quit smoking, you may call the National Cancer Institute’s Smoking Quitline at 1-877-44U-QUIT (1-877-448-7848). Other Lifestyle Changes If you have COPD, especially more severe forms, you may have trouble eating enough because of symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue. As a result, you may not get all of the calories and nutrients you need, which can worsen your symptoms and raise your risk for infections. Talk with your doctor about following an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Your doctor may suggest eating smaller, more frequent meals; resting before eating; and taking vitamins or nutritional supplements. Also, talk with your doctor about what types of activity are safe for you. You may find it hard to remain active with your symptoms. However, physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness. Medicines Bronchodilators Bronchodilators relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Depending on the severity of your COPD, your doctor may prescribe short-acting or long-acting bronchodilators. Short-acting bronchodilators last about 4–6 hours and should be used only when needed. Long-acting bronchodilators last about 12 hours or more and are used every day. Most bronchodilators are taken using a device called an inhaler. This device allows the medicine to go straight to your lungs. Not all inhalers are used the same way. Ask your health care providers to show you the correct way to use your inhaler. If your COPD is mild, your doctor may only prescribe a short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. In this case, you may use the medicine only when symptoms occur. If your COPD is moderate or severe, your doctor may prescribe regular treatment with short- and long-acting bronchodilators. Combination Bronchodilators Plus Inhaled Glucocorticosteroids (Steroids) In general, using inhaled steroids alone is not a preferred treatment. If your COPD is more severe, or if your symptoms flare up often, your doctor may prescribe a combination of medicines that includes a bronchodilator and an inhaled steroid. Steroids help reduce airway inflammation.  Your doctor may ask you to try inhaled steroids with the bronchodilator for a trial period of 6 weeks to 3 months to see whether the addition of the steroid helps relieve your breathing problems. Vaccines Flu Shots The flu, or influenza, can cause serious problems for people who have COPD. Flu shots can reduce your risk of getting the flu. Talk with your doctor about getting a yearly flu shot. Pneumococcal Vaccine This vaccine lowers your risk for pneumococcal pneumonia and its complications. People who have COPD are at higher risk for pneumonia than people who do not have COPD. Talk with your doctor about whether you should get this vaccine. Pulmonary Rehabilitation Pulmonary rehabilitation or rehab is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. Rehab may include an exercise program, disease management training, and nutritional and psychological counseling. The program&apos;s goal is to help you stay active and carry out your daily activities. Your rehab team may include doctors, nurses, physical therapists, respiratory therapists, exercise specialists, and dietitians. These health professionals will create a program that meets your needs. Oxygen Therapy If you have severe COPD and low levels of oxygen in your blood, oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. For this treatment, oxygen is delivered through nasal prongs or a mask. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times. For some people who have severe COPD, using extra oxygen for most of the day can help them: Do tasks or activities while experiencing fewer symptoms Protect their hearts and other organs from damage Sleep more during the night and improve alertness during the day Live longer Surgery Surgery may benefit some people who have COPD. Surgery usually is a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not improved from taking medicines. Surgeries for people who have COPD that is mainly related to emphysema include bullectomy and lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). A lung transplant might be an option for people who have very severe COPD. Bullectomy When the walls of the air sacs are destroyed, larger air spaces called bullae form. These air spaces can become so large that they interfere with breathing. In a bullectomy, doctors remove one or more very large bullae from the lungs. Lung Volume Reduction Surgery In LVRS, surgeons remove damaged tissue from the lungs. This helps the lungs work better. In carefully selected patients, LVRS can improve breathing and quality of life. Lung Transplant During a lung transplant, doctors remove your damaged lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a donor. A lung transplant can improve your lung function and quality of life. However, lung transplants have many risks, such as infections and rejection of the transplanted lung. If you have very severe COPD, talk with your doctor about whether a lung transplant is an option. Ask your doctor about the benefits and risks of this type of surgery. Managing Complications COPD symptoms usually worsen slowly over time. However, they can worsen suddenly. For instance, a cold, flu, or lung infection may cause your symptoms to quickly worsen. You may have a much harder time catching your breath. You also may have chest tightness, more coughing, changes in the color or amount of your sputum or spit, and a fever. Call your doctor right away if your symptoms worsen suddenly. He or she may prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, along with other medicines, such as bronchodilators and inhaled steroids, to help you breathe. Some severe symptoms may require treatment in a hospital. For more information, read Signs and Symptoms.  </AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>COPD (Treatment): A diagnosis of COPD is not the end of the world. Most people have mild forms of the disease for which little therapy is needed other than smoking cessation. Even for more advanced stages of disease, effective therapy is available that can control symptoms, reduce your risk of complications and exacerbations, and improve your ability to lead an active life. Smoking cessation The most essential step in any treatment plan for COPD is to stop all smoking. It&apos;s the only way to keep COPD from getting worse - which can eventually reduce your ability to breathe. But quitting smoking isn&apos;t easy. And this task may seem particularly daunting if you&apos;ve tried to quit and have been unsuccessful. Talk to your doctor about nicotine replacement products and medications that might help, as well as how to handle relapses. Your doctor may also recommend a support group for people who want to quit smoking. It&apos;s also a good idea to avoid secondhand smoke exposure whenever possible. Medications Doctors use several kinds of medications to treat the symptoms and complications of COPD. You may take some medications on a regular basis and others as needed. These medications - which usually come in an inhaler - relax the muscles around your airways. This can help relieve coughing and shortness of breath and make breathing easier. Depending on the severity of your disease, you may need a short-acting bronchodilator before activities, a long-acting bronchodilator that you use every day or both. Short-acting bronchodilators include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others), levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA), and ipratropium (Atrovent). The long-acting bronchodilators include tiotropium (Spiriva), salmeterol (Serevent), formoterol (Foradil, Perforomist), arformoterol (Brovana), indacaterol (Arcapta) and aclidinium (Tudorza). Inhaled corticosteroid medications can reduce airway inflammation and help prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include bruising, oral infections and hoarseness. These medications are useful for people with frequent exacerbations of COPD. Fluticasone (Flovent HFA, Flonase, others) and budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler, Uceris, others) are examples of inhaled steroids. Some medications combine bronchodilators and inhaled steroids. Salmeterol and fluticasone (Advair) and formoterol and budesonide (Symbicort) are examples of combination inhalers. For people who have a moderate or severe acute exacerbation, short courses (for example, five days) of oral corticosteroids prevent further worsening of COPD. However, long-term use of these medications can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts and an increased risk of infection. A new type of medication approved for people with severe COPD and symptoms of chronic bronchitis is roflumilast (Daliresp), a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. This drug decreases airway inflammation and relaxes the airways. Common side effects include diarrhea and weight loss. This very inexpensive medication may help improve breathing and prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include nausea, headache, fast heartbeat and tremor. Side effects are dose related, and low doses are recommended. Respiratory infections, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and influenza, can aggravate COPD symptoms. Antibiotics help treat acute exacerbations, but they aren&apos;t generally recommended for prevention. However, a recent study shows that the antibiotic azithromycin prevents exacerbations, but it isn&apos;t clear whether this is due to its antibiotic effect or its anti-inflammatory properties. Lung therapies Doctors often use these additional therapies for people with moderate or severe COPD: - Oxygen therapy. If there isn&apos;t enough oxygen in your blood, you may need supplemental oxygen. There are several devices to deliver oxygen to your lungs, including lightweight, portable units that you can take with you to run errands and get around town. Some people with COPD use oxygen only during activities or while sleeping. Others use oxygen all the time. Oxygen therapy can improve quality of life and is the only COPD therapy proven to extend life. Talk to your doctor about your needs and options. - Pulmonary rehabilitation program. These programs generally combine education, exercise training, nutrition advice and counseling. You&apos;ll work with a variety of specialists, who can tailor your rehabilitation program to meet your needs. Pulmonary rehabilitation may shorten hospitalizations, increase your ability to participate in everyday activities and improve your quality of life. Talk to your doctor about referral to a program. Managing exacerbations Even with ongoing treatment, you may experience times when symptoms become worse for days or weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation, and it may lead to lung failure if you don&apos;t receive prompt treatment. Exacerbations may be caused by a respiratory infection, air pollution or other triggers of inflammation. Whatever the cause, it&apos;s important to seek prompt medical help if you notice a sustained increase in coughing, a change in your mucus or if you have a harder time breathing. When exacerbations occur, you may need additional medications (such as antibiotics, steroids or both), supplemental oxygen or treatment in the hospital. Once symptoms improve, your doctor will talk with you about measures to prevent future exacerbations, such as quitting smoking, taking inhaled steroids, long-acting bronchodilators or other medications, getting your annual flu vaccine, and avoiding air pollution whenever possible. Surgery Surgery is an option for some people with some forms of severe emphysema who aren&apos;t helped sufficiently by medications alone. Surgical options include: - Lung volume reduction surgery. In this surgery, your surgeon removes small wedges of damaged lung tissue from the upper lungs. This creates extra space in your chest cavity so that the remaining healthier lung tissue can expand and the diaphragm can work more efficiently. In some people, this surgery can improve quality of life and prolong survival. - Lung transplant. Lung transplantation may be an option for certain people who meet specific criteria. Transplantation can improve your ability to breathe and to be active. However, it&apos;s a major operation that has significant risks, such as organ rejection, and it&apos;s necessary to take lifelong immune-suppressing medications. - Bullectomy. Large air spaces (bullae) form in the lungs when the walls of the air sacs are destroyed. These bullae can become very large and cause breathing problems. In a bullectomy, doctors remove bullae from the lungs to help improve air flow.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>COPD (Prevention): You can take steps to prevent COPD before it starts. If you already have COPD, you can take steps to prevent complications and slow the progression of the disease. Prevent COPD Before It Starts The best way to prevent COPD is to not start smoking or to quit smoking. Smoking is the leading cause of COPD. If you smoke, talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. Ask your family members and friends to support you in your efforts to quit. Also, try to avoid lung irritants that can contribute to COPD, such as air pollution, chemical fumes, dusts, and secondhand smoke, which is smoke in the air from other people smoking. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&apos;s Your Guide to a Healthy Heart. Although these resources focus on heart health, they include basic information about how to quit smoking. For free help and support to quit smoking, you may call the National Cancer Institute’s Smoking Quitline at 1-877-44U-QUIT (1-877-448-7848). Prevent Complications and Slow the Progression of COPD If you have COPD, the most important step you can take is to quit smoking. Quitting can help prevent complications and slow the progression of the disease. You also should avoid exposure to the lung irritants mentioned above. Follow your treatments for COPD exactly as your doctor prescribes. They can help you breathe easier, stay more active, and avoid or manage severe symptoms. Talk with your doctor about whether and when you should get flu, or influenza, and pneumonia vaccines. These vaccines can lower your chances of getting these illnesses, which are major health risks for people who have COPD.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Insulin, Medicines, and Other Diabetes Treatments (Do I have other treatment options for my diabetes?): When medicines and lifestyle changes are not enough to manage your diabetes, a less common treatment may be an option. Other treatments include bariatric surgery for certain people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and an &quot;artificial pancreas&quot; and pancreatic islet transplantation for some people with type 1 diabetes.Bariatric surgeryAlso called weight-loss surgery or metabolic surgery, bariatric surgery may help some people with obesity and type 2 diabetes lose a large amount of weight and regain normal blood glucose levels. Some people with diabetes may no longer need their diabetes medicine after bariatric surgery. Whether and for how long blood glucose levels improve seems to vary by the patient, type of weight-loss surgery, and amount of weight the person loses. Other factors include how long someone has had diabetes and whether or not the person uses insulin.1Recent research suggests that weight-loss surgery also may help improve blood glucose control in people with type 1 diabetes who are obese.2Researchers are studying the long-term results of bariatric surgery in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.Artificial PancreasThe NIDDK has played an important role in developing “artificial pancreas” technology. An artificial pancreas replaces manual blood glucose testing and the use of insulin shots or a pump. A single system monitors blood glucose levels around the clock and provides insulin or a combination of insulin and a second hormone, glucagon, automatically. The system can also be monitored remotely, for example by parents or medical staff.In 2016, the FDA approved a type of artificial pancreas system called a hybrid closed-loop system. This system tests your glucose level every 5 minutes throughout the day and night, and automatically gives you the right amount of insulin.You still need to manually adjust the amount of insulin the pump delivers at mealtimes. But, the artificial pancreas may free you from some of the daily tasks needed to keep your blood glucose stable—or help you sleep through the night without the need to wake and test your glucose or take medicine.The hybrid closed-loop system is expected to be available in the U.S. in 2017. Talk with your health care provider about whether this system might be right for you.The NIDDK has funded several important studies on different types of artificial pancreas devices to better help people with type 1 diabetes manage their disease. The devices may also help people with type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes.Pancreatic islet transplantationPancreatic islet transplantation is an experimental treatment for poorly controlled type 1 diabetes. Pancreatic islets are clusters of cells in the pancreas that make the hormone insulin. In type 1 diabetes, the body’s immune system attacks these cells. A pancreatic islet transplant replaces destroyed islets with new ones that make and release insulin. This procedure takes islets from the pancreas of an organ donor and transfers them to a person with type 1 diabetes. Because researchers are still studying pancreatic islet transplantation, the procedure is only available to people enrolled in research studies.

				<AnswerText>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Treatment): There is no cure for COPD. But there are many things you can do to relieve symptoms and keep the disease from getting worse. If you smoke, now is the time to quit. This is the best way to slow lung damage. Medicines used to treat COPD include: - Inhalers (bronchodilators) COPD -- quick-relief drugs to help open the airways - Inhaled COPD -- control drugs or oral steroids to reduce lung inflammation - Anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce swelling in the airways - Certain long-term antibiotics In severe cases or during flare-ups, you may need to receive: - Steroids by mouth or through a vein (intravenously) - Bronchodilators through a nebulizer - Oxygen therapy - Assistance from a machine to help breathing by using a mask, BiPAP, or through the use of an endotracheal tube Your health care provider may prescribe antibiotics during symptom flare-ups, because an infection can make COPD worse. You may need oxygen therapy at home if you have a low level of oxygen in your blood. Pulmonary rehabilitation does not cure COPD. But it can teach you to breathe in a different way so you can stay active and feel better. LIVING WITH COPD You can do things every day to keep COPD from getting worse, protect your lungs, and stay healthy. Walk to build up strength: - Ask the provider or therapist how far to walk. - Slowly increase how far you walk. - Avoid talking if you get short of breath when you walk. - Use pursed lip breathing when you breathe out, to empty your lungs before the next breath. Things you can do to make it easier for yourself around the home include: - Avoid very cold air or very hot weather - Make sure no one smokes in your home - Reduce air pollution by not using the fireplace and getting rid of other irritants - Manage stress in your mood Eat healthy foods, including fish, poultry, and lean meat, as well as fruits and vegetables. If it is hard to keep your weight up, talk to a provider or dietitian about eating foods with more calories. Surgery may be used to treat COPD. Only a few people benefit from these surgical treatments: - Surgery to remove parts of the diseased lung, which can help less-diseased parts work better in some people with emphysema - Lung transplant for a small number of very severe cases</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>COPD (Summary): Summary COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) makes it hard for you to breathe. The two main types are chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The main cause of COPD is long-term exposure to substances that irritate and damage the lungs. This is usually cigarette smoke. Air pollution, chemical fumes, or dust can also cause it. At first, COPD may cause no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, symptoms usually become more severe. They include - A cough that produces a lot of mucus - Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity - Wheezing - Chest tightness Doctors use lung function tests, imaging tests, and blood tests to diagnose COPD. There is no cure. Treatments may relieve symptoms. They include medicines, oxygen therapy, surgery, or a lung transplant. Quitting smoking is the most important step you can take to treat COPD.

				<AnswerText>COPD - managing stress and your mood (How to Manage Stress and Avoid Depression): There are things you can and should do to protect your emotional health. While you cannot get rid of all the stress in your life, you can learn how to manage it. These suggestions may help you relieve stress and stay positive. - Identify the people, places, and situations that cause stress. Knowing what causes you stress can help you avoid or manage it. - Try to avoid things that make you anxious. For example, DO NOT spend time with people who stress you out. Instead, seek out people who nurture and support you. Go shopping during quieter times when there&apos;s less traffic and fewer people around. - Practice relaxation exercises. Deep breathing, visualization, letting go of negative thoughts, and muscle relaxation exercises are all simple ways to release tension and reduce stress. - DO NOT take on too much. Take care of yourself by letting go and learning to say no. For example, perhaps you typically host 25 people for Thanksgiving dinner. Cut it back to 8. Or better yet, ask someone else to host. If you work, talk with your boss about ways to manage your workload so you do not feel overwhelmed. - Stay involved. DO NOT isolate yourself. Make time every week to spend time with friends or attend social events. - Practice positive daily health habits. Get up and get dressed every morning. Move your body every day. Exercise is one of the best stress busters and mood boosters around. Eat a healthy diet and get enough sleep every night. - Talk it out. Share your feelings with trusted family or friends. Or talk with a clergy member. DO NOT keep things bottled up inside. - Follow your treatment plan. When your COPD is well-managed, you will have more energy for the things you enjoy. - DO NOT delay. Get help for depression. Feeling angry, upset, sad, or anxious at times is understandable. Having COPD changes your life, and it can be hard to accept a new way of living. However, depression is more than occasional sadness or frustration. Symptoms of depression include: - Low mood most of the time - Frequent irritability - Not enjoying your usual activities - Trouble sleeping, or sleeping too much - A big change in appetite, often with weight gain or loss - Increased tiredness and lack of energy - Feelings of worthlessness, self-hate, and guilt - Trouble concentrating - Feeling hopeless or helpless - Repeated thoughts of death or suicide If you have symptoms of depression that last for 2 weeks or more, call your doctor. You do not have to live with these feelings. Treatment can help you feel better.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>COPD (Diagnosis): Your doctor will diagnose COPD based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and test results. Your doctor may ask whether you smoke or have had contact with lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, or dusts. If you have an ongoing cough, let your doctor know how long you&apos;ve had it, how much you cough, and how much mucus comes up when you cough. Also, let your doctor know whether you have a family history of COPD. Your doctor will examine you and use a stethoscope to listen for wheezing or other abnormal chest sounds. He or she also may recommend one or more tests to diagnose COPD. Pulmonary Function Tests Pulmonary function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. The main test for COPD is spirometry. Other lung function tests, such as a lung diffusion capacity test, also might be used. Read Pulmonary Function Tests for more information. Spirometry During this painless test, a technician will ask you to take a deep breath in. Then, you&apos;ll blow as hard as you can into a tube connected to a small machine. The machine is called a spirometer. The machine measures how much air you breathe out. It also measures how fast you can blow air out. Spirometry Your doctor may have you inhale, or breathe in, medicine that helps open your airways and then blow into the tube again. He or she can then compare your test results before and after taking the medicine. Spirometry can detect COPD before symptoms develop. Your doctor also might use the test results to find out how severe your COPD is and to help set your treatment goals. The test results also may help find out whether another condition, such as asthma or heart failure, is causing your symptoms. Other Tests Your doctor may recommend other tests, such as: A chest x ray or chest CT scan. These tests create pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. The pictures can show signs of COPD. They also may show whether another condition, such as heart failure, is causing your symptoms. An arterial blood gas test. This blood test measures the oxygen level in your blood using a sample of blood taken from an artery. The results from this test can show how severe your COPD is and whether you need oxygen therapy.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>COPD (Diagnosis): COPD is commonly misdiagnosed - former smokers may sometimes be told they have COPD, when in reality they may have simple deconditioning or another less common lung condition. Likewise, many people who have COPD may not be diagnosed until the disease is advanced and interventions are less effective. To diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your signs and symptoms, discuss your family and medical history, and discuss any exposure you&apos;ve had to lung irritants - especially cigarette smoke. Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose your condition. Tests may include: - Lung (pulmonary) function tests. Pulmonary function tests measure the amount of air you can inhale and exhale, and if your lungs are delivering enough oxygen to your blood. Spirometry is the most common lung function test. During this test, you&apos;ll be asked to blow into a large tube connected to a small machine called a spirometer. This machine measures how much air your lungs can hold and how fast you can blow the air out of your lungs. Spirometry can detect COPD even before you have symptoms of the disease. It can also be used to track the progression of disease and to monitor how well treatment is working. Spirometry often includes measurement of the effect of bronchodilator administration. Other lung function tests include measurement of lung volumes, diffusing capacity and pulse oximetry. - Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show emphysema, one of the main causes of COPD. An X-ray can also rule out other lung problems or heart failure. - CT scan. A CT scan of your lungs can help detect emphysema and help determine if you might benefit from surgery for COPD. CT scans can also be used to screen for lung cancer. - Arterial blood gas analysis. This blood test measures how well your lungs are bringing oxygen into your blood and removing carbon dioxide. - Laboratory tests. Laboratory tests aren&apos;t used to diagnose COPD, but they may be used to determine the cause of your symptoms or rule out other conditions. For example, laboratory tests may be used to determine if you have the genetic disorder alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAt) deficiency, which may be the cause of some cases of COPD. This test may be done if you have a family history of COPD and develop COPD at a young age, such as under age 45.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. Symptoms include breathing difficulty, cough, mucus (sputum) production and wheezing. It&apos;s caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter, most often from cigarette smoke. People with COPD are at increased risk of developing heart disease, lung cancer and a variety of other conditions. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common conditions that contribute to COPD. Chronic bronchitis is inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, which carry air to and from the air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs. It&apos;s characterized by daily cough and mucus (sputum) production. Emphysema is a condition in which the alveoli at the end of the smallest air passages (bronchioles) of the lungs are destroyed as a result of damaging exposure to cigarette smoke and other irritating gases and particulate matter. COPD is treatable. With proper management, most people with COPD can achieve good symptom control and quality of life, as well as reduced risk of other associated conditions. COPD care at Mayo Clinic COPD symptoms often don&apos;t appear until significant lung damage has occurred, and they usually worsen over time, particularly if smoking exposure continues. For chronic bronchitis, the main symptom is a daily cough and mucus (sputum) production at least three months a year for two consecutive years. Other signs and symptoms of COPD may include: - Shortness of breath, especially during physical activities - Wheezing - Chest tightness - Having to clear your throat first thing in the morning, due to excess mucus in your lungs - A chronic cough that may produce mucus (sputum) that may be clear, white, yellow or greenish - Blueness of the lips or fingernail beds (cyanosis) - Frequent respiratory infections - Lack of energy - Unintended weight loss (in later stages) - Swelling in ankles, feet or legs People with COPD are also likely to experience episodes called exacerbations, during which their symptoms become worse than usual day-to-day variation and persist for at least several days. The main cause of COPD in developed countries is tobacco smoking. In the developing world, COPD often occurs in people exposed to fumes from burning fuel for cooking and heating in poorly ventilated homes. Only about 20 to 30 percent of chronic smokers may develop clinically apparent COPD, although many smokers with long smoking histories may develop reduced lung function. Some smokers develop less common lung conditions. They may be misdiagnosed as having COPD until a more thorough evaluation is performed. Air travels down your windpipe (trachea) and into your lungs through two large tubes (bronchi). Inside your lungs, these tubes divide many times - like the branches of a tree - into many smaller tubes (bronchioles) that end in clusters of tiny air sacs (alveoli). The air sacs have very thin walls full of tiny blood vessels (capillaries). The oxygen in the air you inhale passes into these blood vessels and enters your bloodstream. At the same time, carbon dioxide - a gas that is a waste product of metabolism - is exhaled. Your lungs rely on the natural elasticity of the bronchial tubes and air sacs to force air out of your body. COPD causes them to lose their elasticity and overexpand, which leaves some air trapped in your lungs when you exhale. Causes of airway obstruction include: - Emphysema. This lung disease causes destruction of the fragile walls and elastic fibers of the alveoli. Small airways collapse when you exhale, impairing airflow out of your lungs. - Chronic bronchitis. In this condition, your bronchial tubes become inflamed and narrowed and your lungs produce more mucus, which can further block the narrowed tubes. You develop a chronic cough trying to clear your airways. In the vast majority of cases, the lung damage that leads to COPD is caused by long-term cigarette smoking. But there are likely other factors at play in the development of COPD, such as a genetic susceptibility to the disease, because only about 20 to 30 percent of smokers may develop COPD. Other irritants can cause COPD, including cigar smoke, secondhand smoke, pipe smoke, air pollution and workplace exposure to dust, smoke or fumes. In about 1 percent of people with COPD, the disease results from a genetic disorder that causes low levels of a protein called alpha-1-antitrypsin. Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAt) is made in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream to help protect the lungs. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency can affect the liver as well as the lungs. Damage to the lung can occur in infants and children, not only adults with long smoking histories. For adults with COPD related to AAt deficiency, treatment options include those used for people with more-common types of COPD. In addition, some people can be treated by replacing the missing AAt protein, which may prevent further damage to the lungs. Risk factors for COPD include: - Exposure to tobacco smoke. The most significant risk factor for COPD is long-term cigarette smoking. The more years you smoke and the more packs you smoke, the greater your risk. Pipe smokers, cigar smokers and marijuana smokers also may be at risk, as well as people exposed to large amounts of secondhand smoke. - People with asthma who smoke. The combination of asthma, a chronic inflammatory airway disease, and smoking increases the risk of COPD even more. - Occupational exposure to dusts and chemicals. Long-term exposure to chemical fumes, vapors and dusts in the workplace can irritate and inflame your lungs. - Exposure to fumes from burning fuel. In the developing world, people exposed to fumes from burning fuel for cooking and heating in poorly ventilated homes are at higher risk of developing COPD. - Age. COPD develops slowly over years, so most people are at least 40 years old when symptoms begin. - Genetics. The uncommon genetic disorder alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the cause of some cases of COPD. Other genetic factors likely make certain smokers more susceptible to the disease. COPD can cause many complications, including: - Respiratory infections. People with COPD are more likely to catch colds, the flu and pneumonia. Any respiratory infection can make it much more difficult to breathe and could cause further damage to lung tissue. An annual flu vaccination and regular vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia can prevent some infections. - Heart problems. For reasons that aren&apos;t fully understood, COPD can increase your risk of heart disease, including heart attack. Quitting smoking may reduce this risk. - Lung cancer. People with COPD have a higher risk of developing lung cancer. Quitting smoking may reduce this risk. - High blood pressure in lung arteries. COPD may cause high blood pressure in the arteries that bring blood to your lungs (pulmonary hypertension). - Depression. Difficulty breathing can keep you from doing activities that you enjoy. And dealing with serious illness can contribute to development of depression. Talk to your doctor if you feel sad or helpless or think that you may be experiencing depression. COPD is commonly misdiagnosed - former smokers may sometimes be told they have COPD, when in reality they may have simple deconditioning or another less common lung condition. Likewise, many people who have COPD may not be diagnosed until the disease is advanced and interventions are less effective. To diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your signs and symptoms, discuss your family and medical history, and discuss any exposure you&apos;ve had to lung irritants - especially cigarette smoke.

This test may be done if you have a family history of COPD and develop COPD at a young age, such as under age 45. A diagnosis of COPD is not the end of the world. Most people have mild forms of the disease for which little therapy is needed other than smoking cessation. Even for more advanced stages of disease, effective therapy is available that can control symptoms, reduce your risk of complications and exacerbations, and improve your ability to lead an active life. Smoking cessation The most essential step in any treatment plan for COPD is to stop all smoking. It&apos;s the only way to keep COPD from getting worse - which can eventually reduce your ability to breathe. But quitting smoking isn&apos;t easy. And this task may seem particularly daunting if you&apos;ve tried to quit and have been unsuccessful. Talk to your doctor about nicotine replacement products and medications that might help, as well as how to handle relapses. Your doctor may also recommend a support group for people who want to quit smoking. It&apos;s also a good idea to avoid secondhand smoke exposure whenever possible. Medications Doctors use several kinds of medications to treat the symptoms and complications of COPD. You may take some medications on a regular basis and others as needed. These medications - which usually come in an inhaler - relax the muscles around your airways. This can help relieve coughing and shortness of breath and make breathing easier. Depending on the severity of your disease, you may need a short-acting bronchodilator before activities, a long-acting bronchodilator that you use every day or both. Short-acting bronchodilators include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others), levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA), and ipratropium (Atrovent). The long-acting bronchodilators include tiotropium (Spiriva), salmeterol (Serevent), formoterol (Foradil, Perforomist), arformoterol (Brovana), indacaterol (Arcapta) and aclidinium (Tudorza). Inhaled corticosteroid medications can reduce airway inflammation and help prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include bruising, oral infections and hoarseness. These medications are useful for people with frequent exacerbations of COPD. Fluticasone (Flovent HFA, Flonase, others) and budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler, Uceris, others) are examples of inhaled steroids. Some medications combine bronchodilators and inhaled steroids. Salmeterol and fluticasone (Advair) and formoterol and budesonide (Symbicort) are examples of combination inhalers. For people who have a moderate or severe acute exacerbation, short courses (for example, five days) of oral corticosteroids prevent further worsening of COPD. However, long-term use of these medications can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts and an increased risk of infection. A new type of medication approved for people with severe COPD and symptoms of chronic bronchitis is roflumilast (Daliresp), a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. This drug decreases airway inflammation and relaxes the airways. Common side effects include diarrhea and weight loss. This very inexpensive medication may help improve breathing and prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include nausea, headache, fast heartbeat and tremor. Side effects are dose related, and low doses are recommended. Respiratory infections, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and influenza, can aggravate COPD symptoms. Antibiotics help treat acute exacerbations, but they aren&apos;t generally recommended for prevention. However, a recent study shows that the antibiotic azithromycin prevents exacerbations, but it isn&apos;t clear whether this is due to its antibiotic effect or its anti-inflammatory properties. Lung therapies Doctors often use these additional therapies for people with moderate or severe COPD: - Oxygen therapy. If there isn&apos;t enough oxygen in your blood, you may need supplemental oxygen. There are several devices to deliver oxygen to your lungs, including lightweight, portable units that you can take with you to run errands and get around town. Some people with COPD use oxygen only during activities or while sleeping. Others use oxygen all the time. Oxygen therapy can improve quality of life and is the only COPD therapy proven to extend life. Talk to your doctor about your needs and options. - Pulmonary rehabilitation program. These programs generally combine education, exercise training, nutrition advice and counseling. You&apos;ll work with a variety of specialists, who can tailor your rehabilitation program to meet your needs. Pulmonary rehabilitation may shorten hospitalizations, increase your ability to participate in everyday activities and improve your quality of life. Talk to your doctor about referral to a program. Managing exacerbations Even with ongoing treatment, you may experience times when symptoms become worse for days or weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation, and it may lead to lung failure if you don&apos;t receive prompt treatment. Exacerbations may be caused by a respiratory infection, air pollution or other triggers of inflammation. Whatever the cause, it&apos;s important to seek prompt medical help if you notice a sustained increase in coughing, a change in your mucus or if you have a harder time breathing. When exacerbations occur, you may need additional medications (such as antibiotics, steroids or both), supplemental oxygen or treatment in the hospital. Once symptoms improve, your doctor will talk with you about measures to prevent future exacerbations, such as quitting smoking, taking inhaled steroids, long-acting bronchodilators or other medications, getting your annual flu vaccine, and avoiding air pollution whenever possible. Surgery Surgery is an option for some people with some forms of severe emphysema who aren&apos;t helped sufficiently by medications alone. Surgical options include: - Lung volume reduction surgery. In this surgery, your surgeon removes small wedges of damaged lung tissue from the upper lungs. This creates extra space in your chest cavity so that the remaining healthier lung tissue can expand and the diaphragm can work more efficiently. In some people, this surgery can improve quality of life and prolong survival. - Lung transplant. Lung transplantation may be an option for certain people who meet specific criteria. Transplantation can improve your ability to breathe and to be active. However, it&apos;s a major operation that has significant risks, such as organ rejection, and it&apos;s necessary to take lifelong immune-suppressing medications. - Bullectomy. Large air spaces (bullae) form in the lungs when the walls of the air sacs are destroyed. These bullae can become very large and cause breathing problems. In a bullectomy, doctors remove bullae from the lungs to help improve air flow. If you have COPD, you can take steps to feel better and slow the damage to your lungs: - Control your breathing. Talk to your doctor or respiratory therapist about techniques for breathing more efficiently throughout the day. Also be sure to discuss breathing positions and relaxation techniques that you can use when you&apos;re short of breath. - Clear your airways. With COPD, mucus tends to collect in your air passages and can be difficult to clear. Controlled coughing, drinking plenty of water and using a humidifier may help. - Exercise regularly. It may seem difficult to exercise when you have trouble breathing, but regular exercise can improve your overall strength and endurance and strengthen your respiratory muscles. Discuss with your doctor which activities are appropriate for you. - Eat healthy foods. A healthy diet can help you maintain your strength. If you&apos;re underweight, your doctor may recommend nutritional supplements. If you&apos;re overweight, losing weight can significantly help your breathing, especially during times of exertion. - Avoid smoke and air pollution. In addition to quitting smoking, it&apos;s important to avoid places where others smoke. Secondhand smoke may contribute to further lung damage. Other types of air pollution also can irritate your lungs. - See your doctor regularly. Stick to your appointment schedule, even if you&apos;re feeling fine. It&apos;s important to steadily monitor your lung function. And be sure to get your annual flu vaccine in the fall to help prevent infections that can worsen your COPD. Ask your doctor when you need the pneumococcal vaccine. Let your doctor know if you have worsening symptoms or you notice signs of infection.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>COPD: Español   Also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; chronic bronchitis; or emphysema. COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a progressive disease that makes it hard to breathe. Progressive means the disease gets worse over time. COPD can cause coughing that produces large amounts of a slimy substance called mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and other symptoms. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD. Most people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke. However, up to 25 percent of people with COPD never smoked. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants—such as air pollution, chemical fumes, or dusts—also may contribute to COPD. A rare genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency can also cause the disease. Overview To understand COPD, it helps to understand how the lungs work. The air that you breathe goes down your windpipe into tubes in your lungs called bronchial tubes or airways. Within the lungs, your bronchial tubes branch many times into thousands of smaller, thinner tubes called bronchioles. These tubes end in bunches of tiny round air sacs called alveoli. Small blood vessels called capillaries run along the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, a waste product, called carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, moves from the capillaries into the air sacs. This process, called gas exchange, brings in oxygen for the body to use for vital functions and removes the CO2. The airways and air sacs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate and the air goes out. In COPD, less air flows in and out of the airways because of one or more of the following: The airways and air sacs lose their elastic quality. The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed. The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed. The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged. Normal Lungs and Lungs With COPD In the United States, the term COPD includes two main conditions—emphysema and chronic bronchitis. In emphysema, the walls between many of the air sacs are damaged. As a result, the air sacs lose their shape and become floppy. This damage also can destroy the walls of the air sacs, leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. If this happens, the amount of gas exchange in the lungs is reduced. In chronic bronchitis, the lining of the airways stays constantly irritated and inflamed, and this causes the lining to swell. Lots of thick mucus forms in the airways, making it hard to breathe. Most people who have COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but the severity of each condition varies from person to person. Thus, the general term COPD is more accurate. Outlook COPD is a major cause of disability, and it is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Currently, 16 million people are diagnosed with COPD. Many more people may have the disease and not even know it. COPD develops slowly. Symptoms often worsen over time and can limit your ability to do routine activities. Severe COPD may prevent you from doing even basic activities like walking, cooking, or taking care of yourself. Most of the time, COPD is diagnosed in middle-aged or older adults. The disease is not contagious, meaning it cannot be passed from person to person. COPD has no cure yet, and doctors do not know how to reverse the damage to the lungs. However, treatments and lifestyle changes can help you feel better, stay more active, and slow the progress of the disease. Long-term exposure to lung irritants that damage the lungs and the airways usually is the cause of COPD. In the United States, the most common irritant that causes COPD is cigarette smoke. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke also can cause COPD, especially if the smoke is inhaled. Breathing in secondhand smoke, which is in the air from other people smoking; air pollution; or chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace also can contribute to COPD. Rarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency may play a role in causing COPD. People who have this condition have low blood levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT)—a protein made in the liver. Having a low level of the AAT protein can lead to lung damage and COPD if you are exposed to smoke or other lung irritants. If you have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and also smoke, COPD can worsen very quickly. Some people who have asthma can develop COPD. Asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. Treatment usually can reverse the inflammation and narrowing that occurs in asthma.  The main risk factor for COPD is smoking. Up to 75 percent of people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke. People who have a family history of COPD are more likely to develop the disease if they smoke. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants also is a risk factor for COPD. Examples of other lung irritants include air pollution, chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace, and secondhand smoke, which is smoke in the air from other people smoking. Most people who have COPD are at least 40 years old when symptoms begin. Although uncommon, people younger than 40 can have COPD. This may occur, for example, if a person has a predisposing health issue, such as the genetic condition known as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. At first, COPD may cause no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, symptoms usually become more severe. Common signs and symptoms of COPD include: An ongoing cough or a cough that produces a lot of mucus; this is often called smoker&apos;s cough. Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity Wheezing or a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe Chest tightness If you have COPD, you also may often have colds or other respiratory infections such as the flu, or influenza. Not everyone who has the symptoms described above has COPD. Likewise, not everyone who has COPD has these symptoms. Some of the symptoms of COPD are similar to the symptoms of other diseases and conditions. Your doctor can determine if you have COPD. If your symptoms are mild, you may not notice them, or you may adjust your lifestyle to make breathing easier. For example, you may take the elevator instead of the stairs. Over time, symptoms may become severe enough to cause you to see a doctor. For example, you may become short of breath during physical exertion. The severity of your symptoms will depend on how much lung damage you have. If you keep smoking, the damage will occur faster than if you stop smoking. Severe COPD can cause other symptoms, such as swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs; weight loss; and lower muscle endurance. Some severe symptoms may require treatment in a hospital. You—or, if you are unable, family members or friends—should seek emergency care if you are experiencing the following: You are having a hard time catching your breath or talking. Your lips or fingernails turn blue or gray, a sign of a low oxygen level in your blood. People around you notice that you are not mentally alert. Your heartbeat is very fast. The recommended treatment for symptoms that are getting worse is not working. Your doctor will diagnose COPD based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and test results. Your doctor may ask whether you smoke or have had contact with lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, or dusts. If you have an ongoing cough, let your doctor know how long you&apos;ve had it, how much you cough, and how much mucus comes up when you cough. Also, let your doctor know whether you have a family history of COPD. Your doctor will examine you and use a stethoscope to listen for wheezing or other abnormal chest sounds. He or she also may recommend one or more tests to diagnose COPD. Pulmonary Function Tests Pulmonary function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. The main test for COPD is spirometry. Other lung function tests, such as a lung diffusion capacity test, also might be used. Read Pulmonary Function Tests for more information. Spirometry During this painless test, a technician will ask you to take a deep breath in. Then, you&apos;ll blow as hard as you can into a tube connected to a small machine. The machine is called a spirometer. The machine measures how much air you breathe out. It also measures how fast you can blow air out. Spirometry Your doctor may have you inhale, or breathe in, medicine that helps open your airways and then blow into the tube again. He or she can then compare your test results before and after taking the medicine. Spirometry can detect COPD before symptoms develop. Your doctor also might use the test results to find out how severe your COPD is and to help set your treatment goals. The test results also may help find out whether another condition, such as asthma or heart failure, is causing your symptoms. Other Tests Your doctor may recommend other tests, such as: A chest x ray or chest CT scan. These tests create pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. The pictures can show signs of COPD. They also may show whether another condition, such as heart failure, is causing your symptoms. An arterial blood gas test. This blood test measures the oxygen level in your blood using a sample of blood taken from an artery. The results from this test can show how severe your COPD is and whether you need oxygen therapy. COPD has no cure yet. However, lifestyle changes and treatments can help you feel better, stay more active, and slow the progress of the disease. The goals of COPD treatment include: Relieving your symptoms Slowing the progress of the disease Improving your exercise tolerance or your ability to stay active Preventing and treating complications Improving your overall health To assist with your treatment, your family doctor may advise you to see a pulmonologist. This is a doctor who specializes in treating lung disorders. Lifestyle Changes Quit Smoking and Avoid Lung Irritants Quitting smoking is the most important step you can take to treat COPD. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. Ask your family members and friends to support you in your efforts to quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke and places with dusts, fumes, or other toxic substances that you may inhale. For more information about how to quit smoking, read Smoking and Your Heart and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&apos;s Your Guide to a Healthy Heart. Although these resources focus on heart health, they include basic information about how to quit smoking. For free help and support to quit smoking, you may call the National Cancer Institute’s Smoking Quitline at 1-877-44U-QUIT (1-877-448-7848). Other Lifestyle Changes If you have COPD, especially more severe forms, you may have trouble eating enough because of symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue. As a result, you may not get all of the calories and nutrients you need, which can worsen your symptoms and raise your risk for infections. Talk with your doctor about following an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Your doctor may suggest eating smaller, more frequent meals; resting before eating; and taking vitamins or nutritional supplements. Also, talk with your doctor about what types of activity are safe for you. You may find it hard to remain active with your symptoms. However, physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness. Medicines Bronchodilators Bronchodilators relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Depending on the severity of your COPD, your doctor may prescribe short-acting or long-acting bronchodilators. Short-acting bronchodilators last about 4–6 hours and should be used only when needed. Long-acting bronchodilators last about 12 hours or more and are used every day. Most bronchodilators are taken using a device called an inhaler. This device allows the medicine to go straight to your lungs. Not all inhalers are used the same way. Ask your health care providers to show you the correct way to use your inhaler. If your COPD is mild, your doctor may only prescribe a short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. In this case, you may use the medicine only when symptoms occur. If your COPD is moderate or severe, your doctor may prescribe regular treatment with short- and long-acting bronchodilators. Combination Bronchodilators Plus Inhaled Glucocorticosteroids (Steroids) In general, using inhaled steroids alone is not a preferred treatment. If your COPD is more severe, or if your symptoms flare up often, your doctor may prescribe a combination of medicines that includes a bronchodilator and an inhaled steroid. Steroids help reduce airway inflammation.  Your doctor may ask you to try inhaled steroids with the bronchodilator for a trial period of 6 weeks to 3 months to see whether the addition of the steroid helps relieve your breathing problems. Vaccines Flu Shots The flu, or influenza, can cause serious problems for people who have COPD. Flu shots can reduce your risk of getting the flu. Talk with your doctor about getting a yearly flu shot. Pneumococcal Vaccine This vaccine lowers your risk for pneumococcal pneumonia and its complications. People who have COPD are at higher risk for pneumonia than people who do not have COPD. Talk with your doctor about whether you should get this vaccine. Pulmonary Rehabilitation Pulmonary rehabilitation or rehab is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. Rehab may include an exercise program, disease management training, and nutritional and psychological counseling. The program&apos;s goal is to help you stay active and carry out your daily activities. Your rehab team may include doctors, nurses, physical therapists, respiratory therapists, exercise specialists, and dietitians. These health professionals will create a program that meets your needs. Oxygen Therapy If you have severe COPD and low levels of oxygen in your blood, oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. For this treatment, oxygen is delivered through nasal prongs or a mask. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times. For some people who have severe COPD, using extra oxygen for most of the day can help them: Do tasks or activities while experiencing fewer symptoms Protect their hearts and other organs from damage Sleep more during the night and improve alertness during the day Live longer Surgery Surgery may benefit some people who have COPD. Surgery usually is a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not improved from taking medicines. Surgeries for people who have COPD that is mainly related to emphysema include bullectomy and lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). A lung transplant might be an option for people who have very severe COPD. Bullectomy When the walls of the air sacs are destroyed, larger air spaces called bullae form. These air spaces can become so large that they interfere with breathing. In a bullectomy, doctors remove one or more very large bullae from the lungs. Lung Volume Reduction Surgery In LVRS, surgeons remove damaged tissue from the lungs. This helps the lungs work better. In carefully selected patients, LVRS can improve breathing and quality of life. Lung Transplant During a lung transplant, doctors remove your damaged lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a donor. A lung transplant can improve your lung function and quality of life. However, lung transplants have many risks, such as infections and rejection of the transplanted lung. If you have very severe COPD, talk with your doctor about whether a lung transplant is an option. Ask your doctor about the benefits and risks of this type of surgery. Managing Complications COPD symptoms usually worsen slowly over time. However, they can worsen suddenly. For instance, a cold, flu, or lung infection may cause your symptoms to quickly worsen. You may have a much harder time catching your breath. You also may have chest tightness, more coughing, changes in the color or amount of your sputum or spit, and a fever. Call your doctor right away if your symptoms worsen suddenly. He or she may prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, along with other medicines, such as bronchodilators and inhaled steroids, to help you breathe. Some severe symptoms may require treatment in a hospital. For more information, read Signs and Symptoms.   You can take steps to prevent COPD before it starts. If you already have COPD, you can take steps to prevent complications and slow the progression of the disease. Prevent COPD Before It Starts The best way to prevent COPD is to not start smoking or to quit smoking. Smoking is the leading cause of COPD. If you smoke, talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. Ask your family members and friends to support you in your efforts to quit. Also, try to avoid lung irritants that can contribute to COPD, such as air pollution, chemical fumes, dusts, and secondhand smoke, which is smoke in the air from other people smoking. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&apos;s Your Guide to a Healthy Heart. Although these resources focus on heart health, they include basic information about how to quit smoking. For free help and support to quit smoking, you may call the National Cancer Institute’s Smoking Quitline at 1-877-44U-QUIT (1-877-448-7848). Prevent Complications and Slow the Progression of COPD If you have COPD, the most important step you can take is to quit smoking. Quitting can help prevent complications and slow the progression of the disease. You also should avoid exposure to the lung irritants mentioned above. Follow your treatments for COPD exactly as your doctor prescribes. They can help you breathe easier, stay more active, and avoid or manage severe symptoms. Talk with your doctor about whether and when you should get flu, or influenza, and pneumonia vaccines. These vaccines can lower your chances of getting these illnesses, which are major health risks for people who have COPD. COPD has no cure yet. However, you can take steps to manage your symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Avoid lung irritants. Get ongoing care. Manage the disease and its symptoms. Prepare for emergencies. Avoid Lung Irritants If you smoke, quit. Smoking is the leading cause of COPD. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. Ask your family members and friends to support you in your efforts to quit.

For free help and support to quit smoking, you may call the National Cancer Institute’s Smoking Quitline at 1-877-44U-QUIT (1-877-448-7848). Also, try to avoid lung irritants that can contribute to COPD, such as air pollution, chemical fumes, dusts, and secondhand smoke, which is smoke in the air from other people smoking. Keep these irritants out of your home. If you are getting your home painted or sprayed for insects, have it done when you can stay away for a while. If possible, keep your windows closed and stay at home when there is a lot of air pollution or dusts outside. Get Ongoing Care If you have COPD, it is important to get ongoing medical care. Take all your medicines as your doctor prescribes. Make sure to refill your prescriptions before they run out. Bring a list of all the medicines you are taking when you have medical checkups. Talk with your doctor about whether and when you should get flu, or influenza, and pneumonia vaccines. Also, ask him or her about other diseases for which COPD may increase your risk, such as heart disease, lung cancer, and pneumonia. Manage COPD and Its Symptoms You can do things to help manage COPD and its symptoms. For example: Do activities slowly. Put items you use often in one easy-to-reach place. Find simple ways to cook, clean, and do other chores. For example, you might want to use a small table or cart with wheels to move things around and a pole or tongs with long handles to reach things. Ask for help in making things more accessible in your house so that you won&apos;t need to climb stairs as often. Keep your clothes loose, and wear clothes and shoes that are easy to put on and take off. Depending on how severe your disease is, you may want to ask your family and friends for help with daily tasks. Prepare for Emergencies If you have COPD, know when and where to seek help for your symptoms. You should get emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. For more information on severe symptoms of COPD, read Signs and Symptoms. Call your doctor if you notice that your symptoms are worsening or if you have signs of an infection, such as a fever. Your doctor may change or adjust your treatments to relieve and treat symptoms. Keep phone numbers handy for your doctor, hospital, and someone who can take you for medical care. You also should have on hand directions to the doctor&apos;s office and hospital and a list of all the medicines you are taking. Emotional Issues and Support Living with COPD may cause fear, anxiety, depression, and stress. Talk about how you feel with your health care team. Talking to a professional counselor also might help. If you are depressed, your doctor may recommend medicines or other treatments that can improve your quality of life. Joining a patient support group may help you adjust to living with COPD. You can see how other people who have the same symptoms have coped with them. Talk with your doctor about local support groups or check with an area medical center. Support from family and friends also can help relieve stress and anxiety. Let your loved ones know how you feel and what they can do to help you.

				<AnswerURL>https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742</AnswerURL>
				<AnswerText>Obesity: Obesity is a complex disorder involving an excessive amount of body fat. Obesity isn&apos;t just a cosmetic concern. It increases your risk of diseases and health problems, such as heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure. Being extremely obese means you are especially likely to have health problems related to your weight. The good news is that even modest weight loss can improve or prevent the health problems associated with obesity. Dietary changes, increased physical activity and behavior changes can help you lose weight. Prescription medications and weight-loss surgery are additional options for treating obesity. Obesity is diagnosed when your body mass index (BMI) is 30 or higher. Your body mass index is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms (kg) by your height in meters (m) squared. For most people, BMI provides a reasonable estimate of body fat. However, BMI doesn&apos;t directly measure body fat, so some people, such as muscular athletes, may have a BMI in the obese category even though they don&apos;t have excess body fat. Ask your doctor if your BMI is a problem. When to see a doctor If you think you may be obese, and especially if you&apos;re concerned about weight-related health problems, see your doctor or health care provider. You and your provider can evaluate your health risks and discuss your weight-loss options. Although there are genetic, behavioral and hormonal influences on body weight, obesity occurs when you take in more calories than you burn through exercise and normal daily activities. Your body stores these excess calories as fat. Obesity can sometimes be traced to a medical cause, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Cushing&apos;s syndrome, and other diseases and conditions. However, these disorders are rare and, in general, the principal causes of obesity are: - Inactivity. If you&apos;re not very active, you don&apos;t burn as many calories. With a sedentary lifestyle, you can easily take in more calories every day than you use through exercise and normal daily activities. - Unhealthy diet and eating habits. Weight gain is inevitable if you regularly eat more calories than you burn. And most Americans&apos; diets are too high in calories and are full of fast food and high-calorie beverages. Obesity usually results from a combination of causes and contributing factors, including: - Genetics. Your genes may affect the amount of body fat you store, and where that fat is distributed. Genetics may also play a role in how efficiently your body converts food into energy and how your body burns calories during exercise. - Family lifestyle. Obesity tends to run in families. If one or both of your parents are obese, your risk of being obese is increased. That&apos;s not just because of genetics. Family members tend to share similar eating and activity habits. - Inactivity. If you&apos;re not very active, you don&apos;t burn as many calories. With a sedentary lifestyle, you can easily take in more calories every day than you burn through exercise and routine daily activities. Having medical problems, such as arthritis, can lead to decreased activity, which contributes to weight gain. - Unhealthy diet. A diet that&apos;s high in calories, lacking in fruits and vegetables, full of fast food, and laden with high-calorie beverages and oversized portions contributes to weight gain. - Medical problems. In some people, obesity can be traced to a medical cause, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Cushing&apos;s syndrome and other conditions. Medical problems, such as arthritis, also can lead to decreased activity, which may result in weight gain. - Certain medications. Some medications can lead to weight gain if you don&apos;t compensate through diet or activity. These medications include some antidepressants, anti-seizure medications, diabetes medications, antipsychotic medications, steroids and beta blockers. - Social and economic issues. Research has linked social and economic factors to obesity. Avoiding obesity is difficult if you don&apos;t have safe areas to exercise. Similarly, you may not have been taught healthy ways of cooking, or you may not have money to buy healthier foods. In addition, the people you spend time with may influence your weight - you&apos;re more likely to become obese if you have obese friends or relatives. - Age. Obesity can occur at any age, even in young children. But as you age, hormonal changes and a less active lifestyle increase your risk of obesity. In addition, the amount of muscle in your body tends to decrease with age. This lower muscle mass leads to a decrease in metabolism. These changes also reduce calorie needs, and can make it harder to keep off excess weight. If you don&apos;t consciously control what you eat and become more physically active as you age, you&apos;ll likely gain weight. - Pregnancy. During pregnancy, a woman&apos;s weight necessarily increases. Some women find this weight difficult to lose after the baby is born. This weight gain may contribute to the development of obesity in women. - Quitting smoking. Quitting smoking is often associated with weight gain. And for some, it can lead to enough weight gain that the person becomes obese. In the long run, however, quitting smoking is still a greater benefit to your health than continuing to smoke. - Lack of sleep. Not getting enough sleep or getting too much sleep can cause changes in hormones that increase your appetite. You may also crave foods high in calories and carbohydrates, which can contribute to weight gain. Even if you have one or more of these risk factors, it doesn&apos;t mean that you&apos;re destined to become obese. You can counteract most risk factors through diet, physical activity and exercise, and behavior changes. If you&apos;re obese, you&apos;re more likely to develop a number of potentially serious health problems, including: - High triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol - Type 2 diabetes - High blood pressure - Metabolic syndrome - a combination of high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol - Heart disease - Stroke - Cancer, including cancer of the uterus, cervix, endometrium, ovaries, breast, colon, rectum, esophagus, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, kidney and prostate - Breathing disorders, including sleep apnea, a potentially serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts - Gallbladder disease - Gynecological problems, such as infertility and irregular periods - Erectile dysfunction and sexual health issues - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a condition in which fat builds up in the liver and can cause inflammation or scarring - Osteoarthritis Quality of life When you&apos;re obese, your overall quality of life may be diminished. You may not be able to do things you used to do, such as participating in enjoyable activities. You may avoid public places. Obese people may even encounter discrimination. Other weight-related issues that may affect your quality of life include: - Depression - Disability - Sexual problems - Shame and guilt - Social isolation - Lower work achievement If your BMI is in the obese range, your health care provider will typically review your health history in detail, perform a physical exam and recommend some tests. These exams and tests generally include: - Taking your health history. Your doctor may review your weight history, weight-loss efforts, exercise habits, eating patterns, what other conditions you&apos;ve had, medications, stress levels and other issues about your health. Your doctor may also review your family&apos;s health history to see if you may be predisposed to certain conditions. - A general physical exam. This includes also measuring your height; checking vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure and temperature; listening to your heart and lungs; and examining your abdomen. - Calculating your BMI. Your doctor will check your body mass index (BMI) to determine your level of obesity. This should be done at least once a year. Your BMI also helps determine your overall health risk and what treatment may be appropriate. - Measuring your waist circumference. Fat stored around your waist, sometimes called visceral fat or abdominal fat, may further increase your risk of diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease. Women with a waist measurement (circumference) of more than 35 inches (80 centimeters, or cm) and men with a waist measurement of more than 40 inches (102 cm) may have more health risks than do people with smaller waist measurements. Like the BMI measurement, your waist circumference should be checked at least once a year. - Checking for other health problems. If you have known health problems, your doctor will evaluate them. Your doctor will also check for other possible health problems, such as high blood pressure and diabetes. - Blood tests. What tests you have depend on your health, risk factors and any current symptoms you may be having. Tests may include a cholesterol test, liver function tests, a fasting glucose, a thyroid test and others. Your doctor may also recommend certain heart tests, such as an electrocardiogram. Gathering all this information helps you and your doctor determine how much weight you need to lose and what health conditions or risks you already have. And this will guide treatment decisions. The goal of obesity treatment is to reach and stay at a healthy weight. You may need to work with a team of health professionals - including a dietitian, behavior counselor or an obesity specialist - to help you understand and make changes in your eating and activity habits. The initial treatment goal is usually a modest weight loss - 3 to 5 percent of your total weight. That means that if you weigh 200 pounds (91 kg) and are obese by BMI standards, you would need to lose only about 6 to 10 pounds (2.7 to 4.5 kg) for your health to begin to improve. However, the more weight you lose, the greater the benefits. All weight-loss programs require changes in your eating habits and increased physical activity. The treatment methods that are right for you depend on your level of obesity, your overall health and your willingness to participate in your weight-loss plan. Other treatment tools include: - Dietary changes - Exercise and activity - Behavior change - Prescription weight-loss medications - Weight-loss surgery Dietary changes Reducing calories and practicing healthier eating habits are vital to overcoming obesity. Although you may lose weight quickly at first, slow and steady weight loss over the long term is considered the safest way to lose weight and the best way to keep it off permanently. Avoid drastic and unrealistic diet changes, such as crash diets, because they&apos;re unlikely to help you keep excess weight off for the long term. Plan to participate in a comprehensive weight-loss program for at least six months and in the maintenance phase of a program for at least a year to boost your odds of weight-loss success. There is no best weight-loss diet. Choose one that includes healthy foods that you feel will work for you. Dietary changes to treat obesity include: - Cutting calories. The key to weight loss is reducing how many calories you take in. You and your health care providers can review your typical eating and drinking habits to see how many calories you normally consume and where you can cut back. You and your doctor can decide how many calories you need to take in each day to lose weight, but a typical amount is 1,200 to 1,500 calories for women and 1,500 to 1,800 for men. - Feeling full on less. The concept of energy density can help you satisfy your hunger with fewer calories. All foods have a certain number of calories within a given amount (volume). Some foods - such as desserts, candies, fats and processed foods - are high in energy density. This means that a small volume of that food has a large number of calories. In contrast, other foods, such as fruits and vegetables, have lower energy density. These foods provide a larger portion size with a fewer number of calories. By eating larger portions of foods that have fewer calories, you reduce hunger pangs, take in fewer calories and feel better about your meal, which contributes to how satisfied you feel overall. - Making healthier choices. To make your overall diet healthier, eat more plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables and whole-grain carbohydrates. Also emphasize lean sources of protein - such as beans, lentils and soy - and lean meats. If you like fish, try to include fish twice a week. Limit salt and added sugar. Stick with low-fat dairy products. Eat small amounts of fats, and make sure they come from heart-healthy sources, such as olive, canola and nut oils. - Restricting certain foods. Certain diets limit the amount of a particular food group, such as high-carbohydrate or full-fat foods. Ask your doctor which diet plans have been found effective and which might be helpful for you. Drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is a sure way to consume more calories than you intended, and limiting these drinks or eliminating them altogether is a good place to start cutting calories. - Meal replacements. These plans suggest that you replace one or two meals with their products - such as low-calorie shakes or meal bars - and eat healthy snacks and a healthy, balanced third meal that&apos;s low in fat and calories. In the short term, this type of diet can help you lose weight. Keep in mind that these diets likely won&apos;t teach you how to change your overall lifestyle, though, so you may have to keep this up if you want to keep your weight off. Be wary of quick fixes. You may be tempted by fad diets that promise fast and easy weight loss. The reality, however, is that there are no magic foods or quick fixes. Fad diets may help in the short term, but the long-term results don&apos;t appear to be any better than other diets. Similarly, you may lose weight on a crash diet, but you&apos;re likely to regain it when you stop the diet. To lose weight - and keep it off - you have to adopt healthy-eating habits that you can maintain over time. Exercise and activity Increased physical activity or exercise is an essential part of obesity treatment. Most people who are able to maintain their weight loss for more than a year get regular exercise, even simply walking. To boost your activity level: - Exercise. People who are overweight or obese need to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity to prevent further weight gain or to maintain the loss of a modest amount of weight. To achieve more-significant weight loss, you may need to exercise 300 minutes or more a week. You probably will need to gradually increase the amount you exercise as your endurance and fitness improve. - Keep moving. Even though regular aerobic exercise is the most efficient way to burn calories and shed excess weight, any extra movement helps burn calories. Making simple changes throughout your day can add up to big benefits. Park farther from store entrances, rev up your household chores, garden, get up and move around periodically, and wear a pedometer to track how many steps you actually take over the course of a day. Behavior changes A behavior modification program can help you make lifestyle changes and lose weight and keep it off. Steps to take include examining your current habits to find out what factors, stresses or situations may have contributed to your obesity. Everyone is different and has different obstacles to managing weight, such as a lack of time to exercise or late-night eating. Tailor your behavior changes to address your individual concerns. Behavior modification, sometimes called behavior therapy, can include: - Counseling. Therapy or interventions with trained mental health or other professionals can help you address emotional and behavioral issues related to eating. Therapy can help you understand why you overeat and learn healthy ways to cope with anxiety. You can also learn how to monitor your diet and activity, understand eating triggers, and cope with food cravings. Therapy can take place on both an individual and group basis. More-intensive programs - those that include 12 to 26 sessions a year - may be more helpful in achieving your weight-loss goals. - Support groups. You can find camaraderie and understanding in support groups where others share similar challenges with obesity. Check with your doctor, local hospitals or commercial weight-loss programs for support groups in your area, such as Weight Watchers. Prescription weight-loss medication Losing weight requires a healthy diet and regular exercise. But in certain situations, prescription weight-loss medication may help. Keep in mind, though, that weight-loss medication is meant to be used along with diet, exercise and behavior changes, not instead of them. If you don&apos;t make these other changes in your life, medication is unlikely to work. Your doctor may recommend weight-loss medication if other methods of weight loss haven&apos;t worked for you and you meet one of the following criteria: - Your body mass index (BMI) is 30 or greater - Your BMI is greater than 27, and you also have medical complications of obesity, such as diabetes, high blood pressure or sleep apnea Before selecting a medication for you, your doctor will consider your health history, as well as possible side effects. Some weight-loss medications can&apos;t be used by women who are pregnant, or people who take certain medications or have chronic health conditions. Commonly prescribed weight-loss medications include orlistat (Xenical), lorcaserin (Belviq), phentermine and topiramate (Qsymia), buproprion and naltrexone (Contrave), and liraglutide (Saxenda). You will need close medical monitoring while taking a prescription weight-loss medication. Also, keep in mind that a weight-loss medication may not work for everyone, and the effects may wane over time. When you stop taking a weight-loss medication, you may regain much or all of the weight you lost. Weight-loss surgery In some cases, weight-loss surgery, also called bariatric surgery, is an option. Weight-loss surgery limits the amount of food you&apos;re able to comfortably eat or decreases the absorption of food and calories or both. While weight-loss surgery offers the best chance of losing the most weight, it can pose serious risks. Weight-loss surgery for obesity may be considered if you have tried other methods to lose weight that haven&apos;t worked and: - You have extreme obesity (BMI of 40 or higher) - Your BMI is 35 to 39.9, and you also have a serious weight-related health problem, such as diabetes or high blood pressure - You&apos;re committed to making the lifestyle changes that are necessary for surgery to work It doesn&apos;t guarantee that you&apos;ll lose all of your excess weight or that you&apos;ll keep it off long term. Weight-loss success after surgery depends on your commitment to making lifelong changes in your eating and exercise habits. It doesn&apos;t guarantee that you&apos;ll lose all of your excess weight or that you&apos;ll keep it off long term. Weight-loss success after surgery depends on your commitment to making lifelong changes in your eating and exercise habits. Common weight-loss surgeries include: - Gastric bypass surgery. In gastric bypass (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), the surgeon creates a small pouch at the top of your stomach. The small intestine is then cut a short distance below the main stomach and connected to the new pouch. Food and liquid flow directly from the pouch into this part of the intestine, bypassing most of your stomach. - Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). In this procedure, your stomach is separated into two pouches with an inflatable band. Pulling the band tight, like a belt, the surgeon creates a tiny channel between the two pouches. The band keeps the opening from expanding and is generally designed to stay in place permanently. - Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. This procedure begins with the surgeon removing a large part of the stomach. The surgeon leaves the valve that releases food to the small intestine and the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). Then the surgeon closes off the middle section of the intestine and attaches the last part directly to the duodenum. The separated section of the intestine is reattached to the end of the intestine to allow bile and digestive juices to flow into this part of the intestine. - Gastric sleeve. In this procedure, part of the stomach is removed, creating a smaller reservoir for food. It&apos;s a less complicated surgery than gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. Other treatments Vagal nerve blockade is another treatment for obesity. It involves implanting a device under the skin of the abdomen that sends intermittent electrical pulses to the abdominal vagus nerve, which tells the brain when the stomach feels empty or full. This new technology received FDA approval in 2014 for use by adults who have not been able to lose weight with a weight-loss program and who have a BMI of 35 to 45 with at least one obesity-related condition, such as type 2 diabetes. Preventing weight regain after obesity treatment Unfortunately, it&apos;s common to regain weight no matter what obesity treatment methods you try. If you take weight-loss medications, you&apos;ll probably regain weight when you stop taking them. You might even regain weight after weight-loss surgery if you continue to overeat or overindulge in high-calorie foods. But that doesn&apos;t mean your weight-loss efforts are futile. One of the best ways to prevent regaining the weight you&apos;ve lost is to get regular physical activity. Aim for 60 minutes a day. Keep track of your physical activity if it helps you stay motivated and on course. As you lose weight and gain better health, talk to your doctor about what additional activities you might be able to do and, if appropriate, how to give your activity and exercise a boost. You may always have to remain vigilant about your weight. Combining a healthier diet and more activity in a practical and sustainable manner are the best ways to keep the weight you lost off for the long term. Take your weight loss and weight maintenance one day at a time and surround yourself with supportive resources to help ensure your success. Find a healthier way of living that you can stick with for the long term. Your effort to overcome obesity is more likely to be successful if you follow strategies at home in addition to your formal treatment plan. These can include: - Learning about your condition. Education about obesity can help you learn more about why you became obese and what you can do about it. You may feel more empowered to take control and stick to your treatment plan. Read reputable self-help books and consider talking about them with your doctor or therapist. - Setting realistic goals. When you have to lose a significant amount of weight, you may set goals that are unrealistic, such as trying to lose too much too fast. Don&apos;t set yourself up for failure. Set daily or weekly goals for exercise and weight loss. Make small changes in your diet instead of attempting drastic changes that you&apos;re not likely to stick with for the long haul. - Sticking to your treatment plan. Changing a lifestyle you may have lived with for many years can be difficult. Be honest with your doctor, therapist or other health care providers if you find your activity or eating goals slipping. You can work together to come up with new ideas or new approaches. - Enlisting support. Get your family and friends on board with your weight-loss goals. Surround yourself with people who will support you and help you, not sabotage your efforts. Make sure they understand how important weight loss is to your health. You might also want to join a weight-loss support group. - Keeping a record. Keep a food and activity log. This record can help you remain accountable for your eating and exercise habits. You can discover behavior that may be holding you back and, conversely, what works well for you. You can also use your log to track other important health parameters such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels and overall fitness. - Identifying and avoiding food triggers. Distract yourself from your desire to eat with something positive, such as calling a friend. Practice saying no to unhealthy foods and big portions. Eat when you&apos;re actually hungry - not simply when the clock says it&apos;s time to eat. - Taking your medications as directed. If you take weight-loss medications or medications to treat obesity-related conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, take them exactly as prescribed. If you have a problem sticking with your medication regimen or have unpleasant side effects, talk to your doctor. Numerous dietary supplements that promise to help you shed weight quickly are available. The effectiveness, particularly the long-term effectiveness, and safety of these products are often questionable. Herbal remedies, vitamins and minerals, all considered dietary supplements by the Food and Drug Administration, don&apos;t have the same rigorous testing and labeling process as over-the-counter and prescription medications do. Yet some of these substances, including products labeled as &quot;natural,&quot; have drug-like effects that can be dangerous. Even some vitamins and minerals can cause problems when taken in excessive amounts. Ingredients may not be standard, and they can cause unpredictable and harmful side effects. Dietary supplements also can cause dangerous interactions with prescription medications you take. Talk to your doctor before taking any dietary supplements. Mind-body therapies - such as acupuncture, mindfulness meditation and yoga - may complement other obesity treatments. However, these therapies generally haven&apos;t been well-studied in the treatment of weight loss. Talk to your doctor if you&apos;re interested in adding a mind-body therapy to your treatment.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Overweight and Obesity: Español Also known as adiposity. Overweight and obesity are increasingly common conditions in the United States. They are caused by the increase in the size and the amount of fat cells in the body. Doctors measure body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference to screen and diagnose overweight and obesity. Obesity is a serious medical condition that can cause complications such as metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, heart disease, diabetes, high blood cholesterol, cancers and sleep disorders. Treatment depends on the cause and severity of your condition and whether you have complications. Treatments include lifestyle changes, such as heart-healthy eating and increased physical activity, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved weight-loss medicines. For some people, surgery may be a treatment option. Explore this Health Topic to learn more about overweight and obesity, our role in research and clinical trials to improve health, and where to find more information.  Energy imbalances, some genetic or endocrine medical conditions, and certain medicines are known to cause overweight or obesity. Energy imbalances cause the body to store fat Energy imbalances can cause overweight and obesity. An energy imbalance means that your energy IN does not equal your energy OUT. This energy is measured in calories. Energy IN is the amount of calories you get from food and drinks. Energy OUT is the amount of calories that your body uses for things such as breathing, digesting, being physically active, and regulating body temperature. Overweight and obesity develop over time when you take in more calories than you use, or when energy IN is more than your energy OUT. This type of energy imbalance causes your body to store fat. Your body uses certain nutrients such as carbohydrates or sugars, proteins, and fats from the foods you eat to: make energy for immediate use to power routine daily body functions and physical activity. store energy for future use by your body. Sugars are stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles. Fats are stored mainly as triglycerides in fat tissue. The amount of energy that your body gets from the food you eat depends on the type of foods you eat, how the food is prepared, and how long it has been since you last ate. Read more The body has three types of fat tissue—white, brown, and beige—that it uses to fuel itself, regulate its temperature in response to cold, and store energy for future use. Learn about the role of each fat type in maintaining energy balance in the body. White fat tissue can be found around the kidneys and under the skin in the buttocks, thighs, and abdomen. This fat type stores energy, makes hormones that control the way the body regulates urges to eat or stop eating, and makes inflammatory substances that can lead to complications. Brown fat tissue is located in the upper back area of human infants. This fat type releases stored energy as heat energy when a baby is cold. It also can make inflammatory substances. Brown fat can be seen in children and adults. Beige fat tissue is seen in the neck, shoulders, back, chest and abdomen of adults and resembles brown fat tissue. This fat type, which uses carbohydrates and fats to produce heat, increases when children and adults are exposed to cold. Medical conditions Some genetic syndromes and endocrine disorders can cause overweight or obesity. Genetic syndromes Several genetic syndromes are associated with overweight and obesity, including the following. Prader-Willi syndrome Bardet-Biedl syndrome Alström syndrome Cohen syndrome The study of these genetic syndromes has helped researchers understand obesity. Endocrine disorders Because the endocrine system produces hormones that help maintain energy balances in the body, the following endocrine disorders or tumors affecting the endocrine system can cause overweight and obesity. Hypothyroidism. People with this condition have low levels of thyroid hormones. These low levels are associated with decreased metabolism and weight gain, even when food intake is reduced. People with hypothyroidism also produce less body heat, have a lower body temperature, and do not efficiently use stored fat for energy. Cushing’s syndrome. People with this condition have high levels of glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, in the blood. High cortisol levels make the body feel like it is under chronic stress. As a result, people have an increase in appetite and the body will store more fat. Cushing’s syndrome may develop after taking certain medicines or because the body naturally makes too much cortisol. Tumors. Some tumors, such as craneopharingioma, can cause severe obesity because the tumors develop near parts of the brain that control hunger. Medicines Medicines such as antipsychotics, antidepressants, antiepileptics, and antihyperglycemics can cause weight gain and lead to overweight and obesity. Talk to your doctor if you notice weight gain while you are using one of these medicines. Ask if there are other forms of the same medicine or other medicines that can treat your medical condition, but have less of an effect on your weight. Do not stop taking the medicine without talking to your doctor. Read more Several parts of your body, such as your stomach, intestines, pancreas, and fat tissue, use hormones to control how your brain decides if you are hungry or full. Some of these hormones are insulin, leptin, glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1), peptide YY, and ghrelin. Look for Research for Your Health will explain how we are using current research and advancing research to understand, prevent and treat overweight and obesity. Risk Factors will discuss family history, lifestyle, or other environmental factors that increase your risk of developing overweight and obesity.   There are many risk factors for overweight and obesity. Some risk factors can be changed, such as unhealthy lifestyle habits and environments. Other risk factors, such as age, family history and genetics, race and ethnicity, and sex, cannot be changed. Heathy lifestyle changes can decrease your risk for developing overweight and obesity. Unhealthy lifestyle habits Lack of physical activity, unhealthy eating patterns, not enough sleep, and high amounts of stress can increase your risk for overweight and obesity. Lack of physical activity Lack of physical activity due to high amounts of TV, computer, videogame or other screen usage has been associated with a high body mass index. Healthy lifestyle changes, such as being physically active and reducing screen time, can help you aim for a healthy weight. Unhealthy eating behaviors Some unhealthy eating behaviors can increase your risk for overweight and obesity. Eating more calories than you use. The amount of calories you need will vary based on your sex, age, and physical activity level. Find out your daily calorie needs or goals with the Body Weight Planner. Eating too much saturated and trans fats Eating foods high in added sugars Visit Heart-healthy eating for more information about healthy eating patterns. Not enough sleep Many studies have seen a high BMI in people who do not get enough sleep. Some studies have seen a relationship between sleep and the way our bodies use nutrients for energy and how lack of sleep can affect hormones that control hunger urges. Visit our Sleep Deprivation and Deficiency Health Topic for more information about lack of sleep. High amounts of stress Acute stress and chronic stress affect the brain and trigger the production of hormones, such as cortisol, that control our energy balances and hunger urges. Acute stress can trigger hormone changes that make you not want to eat. If the stress becomes chronic, hormone changes can make you eat more and store more fat. Age Childhood obesity remains a serious problem in the United States, and some populations are more at risk for childhood obesity than others. The risk of unhealthy weight gain increases as you age. Adults who have a healthy BMI often start to gain weight in young adulthood and continue to gain weight until 60 to 65 years old, when they tend to start losing weight. Unhealthy environments Many environmental factors can increase your risk for overweight and obesity:   social factors such as having a low socioeconomic status or an unhealthy social or unsafe environment in the neighborhood  built environment factors such as easy access to unhealthy fast foods, limited access to recreational facilities or parks, and few safe or easy ways to walk in your neighborhood exposure to chemicals known as obesogens that can change hormones and increase fatty tissue in our bodies Family history and genetics Genetic studies have found that overweight and obesity can run in families, so it is possible that our genes or DNA can cause these conditions. Research studies have found that certain DNA elements are associated with obesity. Read more Did you know obesity can change your DNA and the DNA you pass on to your children? Learn more about these DNA changes. Eating too much or eating too little during your pregnancy can change your baby’s DNA and can affect how your child stores and uses fat later in life. Also, studies have shown that obese fathers have DNA changes in their sperm that can be passed on to their children. Race or ethnicity Overweight and obesity is highly prevalent in some racial and ethnic minority groups. Rates of obesity in American adults are highest in blacks, followed by Hispanics, then whites. This is true for men or women. While Asian men and women have the lowest rates of unhealthy BMIs, they may have high amounts of unhealthy fat in the abdomen. Samoans may be at risk for overweight and obesity because they may carry a DNA variant that is associated with increased BMI but not with common obesity-related complications. Sex In the United States, obesity is more common in black or Hispanic women than in black or Hispanic men. A person’s sex may also affect the way the body stores fat. For example, women tend to store less unhealthy fat in the abdomen than men do. Overweight and obesity is also common in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This is an endocrine condition that causes large ovaries and prevents proper ovulation, which can reduce fertility.     Children and adults should be screened at least annually to see if they have a high or increasing body mass index (BMI), which allows doctors to recommend healthy lifestyle changes to prevent overweight and obesity. Screening for a high or increasing body mass index (BMI) To screen for overweight and obesity, doctors measure BMI using calculations that depend on whether you are a child or an adult. After reading the information below, talk to your doctor or your child’s doctor to determine if you or your child has a high or increasing BMI. Children: A healthy weight is usually when your child’s BMI is at the 5th percentile up to the 85th percentile, based on growth charts for children who are the same age and sex. To figure out your child’s BMI, use the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) BMI Percentile Calculator for Child and Teen and compare the BMI with the table below. Adults: A healthy weight for adults is usually when your BMI is 18.5 to less than 25. To figure out your BMI, use the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s online BMI calculator and compare it with the table below. You can also download the BMI calculator app for iPhone and Android. Healthy lifestyle changes to prevent overweight and obesity If your BMI indicates you are getting close to being overweight, or if you have certain risk factors, your doctor may recommend you adopt healthy lifestyle changes to prevent you from becoming overweight and obese. Changes include healthy eating, being physically active, aiming for a healthy weight,and getting healthy amounts of sleep. Read healthy lifestyle changes for more information. Look for Diagnosis will explain tests and procedures that your doctor may use to diagnose overweight and obesity. Living With will discuss what your doctor may recommend to monitor and prevent your condition from getting worse and to screen you for complications. Research for Your Health will explain how we are using current research and advancing research to prevent overweight and obesity. Participate in NHLBI Clinical Trials will discuss our open clinical trials that are studying ways to prevent overweight and obesity. There are no specific symptoms of overweight and obesity. The signs of overweight and obesity include a high body mass index (BMI) and an unhealthy body fat distribution that can be estimated by measuring your waist circumference. Obesity can cause complications in many parts of your body.   High body mass index (BMI) A high BMI is the most common sign of overweight and obesity. Unhealthy body fat distribution Another sign of overweight and obesity is having an unhealthy body fat distribution. Fatty tissue is found in different parts of your body and has many functions. Having an increased waist circumference suggests that you have increased amounts of fat in your abdomen. An increased waist circumference is a sign of obesity and can increase your risk for obesity-related complications. Read more Did you know that fatty tissue has different functions depending on its location in your body? Visceral fat is the fatty tissue inside of your abdomen and organs. While we do not know what causes the body to create and store visceral fat, it is known that this type of fat interferes with the body’s endocrine and immune systems and promotes chronic inflammation and contributes to obesity-related complications. Complications Obesity may cause the following complications: Metabolic Syndrome Type 2 diabetes High blood cholesterol and high triglyceride levels in the blood Diseases of the heart and blood vessels such as high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, heart attacks and stroke Respiratory problems such as obstructive sleep apnea , asthma, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome Back pain   Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) Osteoarthritis, a chronic inflammation that damages the cartilage and bone in or around the affected joint. It can cause mild or severe pain and usually affects weight-bearing joints in people who are obese. It is a major cause of knee replacement surgery in patients who are obese for a long time. Urinary incontinence, the unintentional leakage of urine. Chronic obesity can weaken pelvic muscles, making it harder to maintain bladder control. While it can happen to both sexes, it usually affects women as they age. Gallbladder disease Emotional health issues such as low self-esteem or depression. This may commonly occur in children. Cancers of the esophagus, pancreas, colon, rectum, kidney, endometrium, ovaries, gallbladder, breast, or liver. Read more Did you know inflammation is thought to play a role in the onset of certain obesity-related complications? Researchers now know more about visceral fat, which is deep in the abdomen of overweight and obese patients. Visceral fat releases factors that promote inflammation. Chronic obesity-related inflammation is thought to lead to insulin resistance and diabetes, changes in the liver or non-alcoholic fatty acid liver disease, and cancers. More research is needed to understand what triggers inflammation in some obese patients and to find new treatments. Look for Diagnosis will explain tests and procedures used to detect signs of overweight and obesity and help rule our other conditions that may be causing weight gain. Treatment will discuss treatment-related complications or side effects. Living With will explain how doctors use waist circumference to monitor for disease severity and check for complications.   Your doctor may diagnose overweight and obesity based on your medical history, physical exams that confirm you have a high body mass index (BMI) and possibly a high waist circumference, and tests to rule out other medical conditions. Confirming a high body mass index (BMI) To diagnose overweight and obesity, doctors measure BMI using calculations that depend on whether you are a child or an adult. Children: A healthy weight is usually when your child’s BMI is at the 5th percentile up to less than the 85th percentile based on growth charts for children who are the same age and sex. To figure out your child’s BMI, use the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) BMI Percentile Calculator for Child and Teen and compare the BMI with the table below. Adults: A healthy weight for adults is usually when your BMI is 18.5 to less than 25. To figure out your BMI, use the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s online BMI calculator and compare it with the table below. You can also download the BMI calculator app for iPhone and Android. Even if your BMI is in the healthy range, it is possible to be diagnosed as obese if you have a large waist circumference that suggests increased amounts of fat in your abdomen that can lead to complications. Medical history Your doctor will ask about your eating and physical activity habits, family history, and will see if you have other risk factors Your doctor may ask if you have any other signs or symptoms. This information can help determine if you have other conditions that may be causing you to be overweight or obese or if you have complications from being overweight or obese. Physical exam During your physical exam, your doctor will measure your weight and height to calculate your BMI. Your doctor may also measure your waist circumference to estimate the amount of unhealthy fat in your abdomen. In adults, a waist circumference over 35 inches for women who are not pregnant or 40 inches for men can help diagnose obesity and assess risk of future complications. If you are of South Asian or Central and South American descent, your doctor may use smaller waist circumference values to diagnose your obesity. People from these backgrounds often don’t show signs of a large waist circumference even though they may have unhealthy amounts of fat deep in their abdomens and may be diagnosed with obesity. Visit Assessing Your Weight for more information. Read Living With for more information about why it is important to monitor your waist circumference to assess your risk for complications. Tests to identify other medical conditions Your doctor may order some of the following tests to identify medical conditions that may be causing your overweight and obesity. Blood tests. Blood tests that check your thyroid hormone levels can help rule out hypothyroidism as a cause of your overweight or obesity. Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) tests can rule out Cushing’s syndrome. Total testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) tests can help rule out polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Pelvic ultrasound to examine the ovaries and detect cysts. This can rule out PCOS. Reminders Return to Risk Factors to review family history, lifestyle, or other environmental factors that increase your risk of developing overweight and obesity. Return to Signs, Symptoms, and Complications to review common signs and symptoms of overweight and obesity. Return to Screening and Prevention to review how to screen for overweight and obesity. Treatment for overweight and obesity depends on the cause and severity of your condition. Possible treatments include healthy lifestyle changes, behavioral weight-loss treatment programs, medicines, and possibly surgery. You may need treatments for any complications that you have. Healthy lifestyle changes To help you aim for and maintain a healthy weight, your doctor may recommend that you adopt lifelong healthy lifestyle changes. Heart-healthy eating. Learn about which foods and nutrients are part of a healthy eating pattern. It’s important to eat the right amount of calories to maintain a healthy weight. If you need to lose weight, try to reduce your total daily calories gradually. Use the Body Weight Planner to find out your daily calorie needs and to set goals. Visit healthy recipes and plan for success. Talk with your doctor before beginning any diet or eating plan. Visit Chose My Plate or 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans for more information. Physical activity. Many health benefits are associated with physical activity and getting the recommended amount of physical activity needed each week. Physical activity is an important factor in determining whether a person can maintain a healthy body weight, lose excess body weight, or maintain successful weight loss. Before starting any exercise program, ask your doctor about what level of physical activity is right for you. Visit Physical Activity Has Many Health Benefits for more information. Healthy Sleep. Studies have shown some relationship between lack of sleep and obesity. Read Sleep Deprivation and Deficiency more information. Making lifelong healthy lifestyle changes, such as heart-healthy eating and physical activity, can help you modify your energy balance to help you aim for and maintain a healthy weight. For example: To aim for a healthy weight, or lose weight, you want your energy OUT to be more than your energy IN. To maintain weight loss you want your energy IN and energy OUT to be the same.  Behavioral weight-loss programs Your doctor may recommend you enroll in individual or group behavioral weight-loss programs to treat your overweight and obesity. In these programs, a trained healthcare professional will customize a weight-loss plan for you. This plan will include a moderately-reduced calorie diet, physical activity goals, and behavioral strategies to help you make and maintain these lifestyle changes. Read Living With for more information about required follow-up for these behavioral treatment programs. Read more Did you know your brain’s pleasure and reward centers can be stimulated by food and the act of eating, making it harder to change eating patterns and lose weight? Researchers know that our brains can become patterned so that we feel pleasure or reward from eating. This can make us unconsciously crave food so our bodies feel that sense of pleasure. It can also make it hard to change our eating patterns, lose weight, or maintain a healthy weight. Researchers are studying whether cognitive behavioral therapies can be an effective treatment for overweight and obesity by retraining the brain to not associate pleasure with food and the act of eating. Medicines When healthy lifestyle changes are not enough, your doctor may treat your overweight and obesity with FDA-approved medicines. These medicines work in the following parts of your body. Brain. Several medicines change the way the brain regulates the urge to eat, which can help to decrease appetite. Some examples of these medicines are diethylpropion, phendimetrazine, lorcaserin, naltrexone/bupropion, and liraglutide. Gastrointestinal tract. Orlistat is the only available medicine. It blocks your intestines from absorbing fat from foods in your diet. Weight loss medicines are not recommended as a single treatment for weight loss. These medicines can help you lose weight but when combined with lifestyle changes may result in greater weight loss. Some of these medicines should not be used if you have certain conditions or are taking certain medicines. Also, these medicines have side effects. Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant, planning to get pregnant, breast feeding, or have a family history of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack, or stroke. Surgical procedures Some patients with obesity do not respond to healthy lifestyle changes and medicines. When these patients develop certain obesity-related complications, they may be eligible for the following surgeries. Gastric bypass surgery. A small part of the stomach is connected to the middle part of the intestine, bypassing the first part of intestine. This decreases the amount of food that you can eat and the amount of fat your body can take in and store. Gastrectomy. A big portion of the stomach is removed to decrease the amount of food that you can eat. Gastric banding. A hollow band is placed around the upper part of the stomach creating a smaller stomach. This decreases the amount of food you can eat. Talk to your doctor to learn more about the benefits and risks of each type of surgery. Possible complications include bleeding, infection, internal rupture of sutures, or even death. Read gastric bypass surgery for more information. Read more Interested in learning why these surgeries lead to weight loss in some patients? First, these surgeries reduce the amount of food stored in the stomach and the amount of calories your body can take in. This can help your body restore energy balance. Second, these surgeries change the levels of certain hormones and the way the brain responds to these hormones to control hunger urges. After surgery, some people are less interested in eating or they prefer to eat healthier foods. In some cases, genetic differences may affect how much weight loss patients experience after bariatric surgery.

Read about tips to help you aim for a healthy weight, the benefit of finding and continuing a behavioral weight-loss program, and ways your doctor may monitor if your condition is stable, worsening, or improving and assess your risk for complications. Tips to aim for a healthy weight Changing lifestyle habits takes time and patience. Follow these tips to help you maintain the healthy lifestyle changes your doctor recommended to aim for a healthy weight. Use our Daily Food and Activity Diary or the United States Department of Agriculture’s online SuperTracker to record your daily food intake and physical activity. You, your doctor, or health care provider can use this diary to monitor your progress. Set specific goals. An example of a specific goal is to “walk 30 minutes, 5 days a week&quot;. Be realistic about your time and abilities. Set doable goals that don’t change too much at once. Consecutive goals that can move you ahead in small steps, are the best way to reach a distant point. When starting a new lifestyle, try to avoid changing too much at once. Slow changes lead to success. Remember, quick weight loss methods do not provide lasting results. Learn from your slips. Everyone slips, especially when learning something new. Don’t worry if work, the weather, or your family causes you to have an occasional slip. Remember that changing your lifestyle is a long-term process. Find out what triggered the slip and restart your eating and physical activity plan. Celebrate your success. Reward yourself along the way as you meet your goals. Instead of eating out to celebrate your success, try a night at the movies, go shopping for workout clothes, visit the library or bookstore, or go on a hike. Identify temptations. Learn what environments or social activities, such as watching TV or going out with friends, may be keeping you from meeting your goals. Once you have identified them, use creative strategies to help keep you on track.   Plan regular physical activity with a friend. Find a fun activity that you both enjoy, such as Zumba, jogging, biking or swimming. You are more likely to stick with that activity if you and a friend have committed to it.   Visit More Information for important NHLBI resources to help you aim for a healthy weight. Find and continue a behavioral weight-loss program Some people find it is easier to aim and maintain a healthy weight when they have support from a weight-loss specialist or other individuals who also are trying to lose weight. Behavioral weight-loss programs can provide this support, and they can help you set goals that are specific to your needs. Your weight-loss specialist usually reviews or modifies your goals every six months based on your progress and overall health. When you are choosing a behavioral weight-loss program, you may want to consider whether the program should: offer the service of multiple professionals, such as registered dietitians, doctors, nurses, psychologists, and exercise physiologists. provide goals that have been customized for you that consider things such as the types of food you like, your schedule, your physical fitness, and your overall health. provide individual or group counseling to help you change your eating patterns and personal unhealthy habits. teach long-term strategies to deal with problems that can lead to future weight gain, such as stress or slipping back into unhealthy habits. When selecting a program, you may want to ask about: the percentage of people who complete the program. the average weight loss for people who finish the program. possible side effects. fees or costs for additional items such as dietary supplements. Monitoring your condition and its health risks You should visit your health care provider periodically to monitor for possible complications, which if left untreated can be life-threatening. Your doctor may do any of the following to monitor your condition. Assess your weight loss since your last visit. A weight loss of approximately five percent in an overweight patient may improve the function of the fat tissue and help lower bad cholesterol and other substances that can predispose to complications. Measure your waist circumference if you are an adult. If your waist circumference is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men, you may be at risk for heart disease, stroke, or type 2 diabetes. South Asians and South and Central Americans have a higher risk of complications, so waist circumference should be smaller than 35 for man and 31 for women. To correctly measure your waist, stand and place a tape measure around your middle, just above your hip bones. Measure your waist just after you breathe out. Visit Assessing Your Weight for more information. Order blood tests to screen for complications. A lipid panel test can check if you have high cholesterol or triglyceride levels in your blood. A liver function test can determine if your liver is working properly. A fasting glucose test can find out if you have prediabetes or diabetes.   The NHLBI is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ National Institutes of Health (NIH)—the nation’s biomedical research agency that makes important scientific discovery to improve health and save lives.

				<AnswerText>What is Obesity?: Obesity means having too much body fat. It is different from being overweight, which means weighing too much. The weight may come from muscle, bone, fat, and/or body water. Both terms mean that a person&apos;s weight is greater than what&apos;s considered healthy for his or her height. Obesity occurs over time when you eat more calories than you use. The balance between calories-in and calories-out differs for each person. Factors that might affect your weight include your genetic makeup, overeating, eating high-fat foods, and not being physically active. Being obese increases your risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, and some cancers. If you are obese, losing even 5 to 10 percent of your weight can delay or prevent some of these diseases. For example, that means losing 10 to 20 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds.

				<AnswerText>Obesity and Overweight: Overweight and obesity mean that a person is in a weight range, given his or her height, that can cause health problems. Obesity causes even greater health risks than being overweight. The NICHD is one of many federal agencies and NIH Institutes working to understand overweight and obesity. The NICHD supports and conducts research on the causes of excess weight, how to prevent and treat obesity, and related topics, including conditions caused by obesity. What are obesity, overweight, and body composition? Body composition is a term that describes how much of a person’s body is made up of bone, fat, water, and other substances. “Overweight” and “obesity” both mean that a person is at an unhealthy weight. An obese person has too much body fat. An overweight person weighs too much, but the extra weight may come from muscle, bone, body water, and/or fat. Health care providers often use body mass index (BMI) to determine if a person is overweight or obese. Adults who have a BMI between 25 and 29.9 are generally considered overweight. Adults who have a BMI of 30 or higher are considered obese. A child’s weight status is determined using a special chart that takes into account the child’s age and gender. Learn more about BMI and other measurements of overweight and obesity. How many people are affected/at risk? » More than 35% of U.S. adults are obese, and more than 34% are overweight. Obesity affects 17% of all children and adolescents in the United States, which is three times the prevalence from just one generation ago. Nearly 32% of children and adolescents are either overweight or obese. « Condition Information How are they diagnosed? » Using Body Mass Index The most common way to determine if a person is overweight or obese is to calculate body mass index (BMI). BMI is an estimate of body fat based on comparing a person’s weight to his or her height. Health care providers also look at BMI, along with information about additional risk factors, to determine a person’s risk for developing weight-related diseases. Usually, the higher a person’s BMI, the higher the risk of disease. BMI for Adults An adult’s BMI can be determined using a BMI calculator. Health care providers use BMI ranges to indicate a person&apos;s weight status. For adults, a BMI of: - 18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal weight - 25.0 to 29.9 is considered overweight - 30.0 to 39.9 is considered obese - 40.0 and higher is considered extremely obese It is important to remember that although BMI is generally a good way to estimate how much body fat a person has, it does not measure body fat directly and therefore is not reliable in all cases. For example, a person may weigh extra because he or she is athletic and has a lot of muscle, and not because he or she has excess body fat. BMI for Children and Teens For children age 2 and older and for teens, BMI uses weight and height, but adds sex and age into the calculation. Instead of using a specific number like the BMI charts for adults, the BMI for children and teens is listed as a percent. This percentage indicates a child’s BMI in relation to the BMIs of other children of the same sex and age. A child and teen BMI calculator can provide a BMI. Children age 2 and older are considered: - At a healthy weight if their BMI falls between the 5th and the 85th percentiles - Overweight if their BMI is between the 85th and 95th percentiles - Obese if their BMI is at or higher than the 95th percentile Other Ways to Measure Body Fat Body fat can be measured in other ways in addition to BMI, including waist circumference, calculation of waist-to-hip circumference ratios, measuring the thickness of a skinfold (a pinch of skin and fat), and techniques such as ultrasound that are more precise than BMI. A health care provider can help determine if such tests are necessary. « How many people are affected/at risk? What are the treatments? » To maintain a healthy weight, it is important to create a balance between the calories eaten and the calories burned through physical activity and bodily functions. To lose weight, a person usually needs to reduce calories and increase physical activity. If lifestyle changes are not enough, medicines and weight-loss surgery also are options for some people who need to lose weight. What are some tips for healthy eating? - Emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products. - Include lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, eggs, and nuts. - Eat a diet low in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, salt (sodium), and added sugars. - Drink more water instead of sugary drinks. How much physical activity does an adult need? Getting enough physical activity is an important way to help prevent or reduce overweight and obesity and related health problems. - Adults age 18 and older need at least 30 minutes of physical activity on 5 or more days of the week to be healthy. - Children and teens need at least 60 minutes of activity a day for their health. Learn more about weight-loss techniques, medications, and surgery options. « How are they diagnosed? What causes it? » A number of factors can play a role in weight gain. These include diet, lack of exercise, factors in a person’s environment, and genetics. Some of these factors are discussed briefly below. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute offers more information on the causes of overweight and obesity. Food and Activity People gain weight when they eat more calories than they burn through activity. This imbalance is the greatest contributor to weight gain. Environment The world around us influences our ability to maintain a healthy weight. For example: - Not having area parks, sidewalks, and affordable gyms makes it hard for people to be physically active. - Oversized food portions increase Americans’ calorie intake, making even more physical activity necessary to maintain a healthy weight. - Some people don’t have access to supermarkets that sell affordable healthy foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables. - Food advertising encourages people to buy unhealthy foods, such as high-fat snacks and sugary drinks. Genetics Research shows that genetics plays a role in obesity. Genes can directly cause obesity in such disorders as Prader-Willi syndrome. Genes also may contribute to a person’s susceptibility to weight gain. Scientists believe that genes may increase a person’s likelihood of becoming obese but that outside factors, such as an abundant food supply or little physical activity, also may be required for a person to put on excess weight. Health Conditions and Medications Some hormone problems may cause overweight and obesity, such as underactive thyroid, Cushing syndrome and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Certain medicines also may cause weight gain, including some corticosteroids, antidepressants, and seizure medicines. Stress, Emotional Factors, and Poor Sleep Some people eat more than usual when they are bored, angry, upset, or stressed. Studies also have found that the less people sleep, the more likely they are to be overweight or obese. This is partly because hormones that are released during sleep control appetite and the body’s use of energy. « What are the treatments?

				<AnswerText>Childhood obesity: Childhood obesity is a serious medical condition that affects children and adolescents. Children who are obese are above the normal weight for their age and height. Childhood obesity is particularly troubling because the extra pounds often start children on the path to health problems that were once considered adult problems - diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Many obese children become obese adults, especially if one or both parents are obese. Childhood obesity can also lead to poor self-esteem and depression. One of the best strategies to reduce childhood obesity is to improve the eating and exercise habits of your entire family. Treating and preventing childhood obesity helps protect your child&apos;s health now and in the future. Not all children carrying extra pounds are overweight or obese. Some children have larger than average body frames. And children normally carry different amounts of body fat at the various stages of development. So you might not know just by looking at your child if weight is a health concern. The body mass index (BMI), which provides a guideline of weight in relation to height, is the accepted measure of overweight and obesity. Your child&apos;s doctor can help you figure out if your child&apos;s weight could pose health problems by using growth charts, the BMI and, if necessary, other tests. When to see a doctor If you&apos;re worried that your child is putting on too much weight, talk to his or her doctor. Your child&apos;s doctor will consider your child&apos;s history of growth and development, your family&apos;s weight-for-height history, and where your child lands on the growth charts. This can help determine if your child&apos;s weight is in an unhealthy range. Lifestyle issues - too little activity and too many calories from food and drinks - are the main contributors to childhood obesity. But genetic and hormonal factors might play a role as well. For example, recent research has found that changes in digestive hormones can affect the signals that let you know you&apos;re full. Many factors - usually working in combination - increase your child&apos;s risk of becoming overweight: - Diet. Regularly eating high-calorie foods, such as fast foods, baked goods and vending machine snacks, can easily cause your child to gain weight. Candy and desserts also can cause weight gain, and more and more evidence points to sugary drinks, including fruit juices, as culprits in obesity in some people. - Lack of exercise. Children who don&apos;t exercise much are more likely to gain weight because they don&apos;t burn as many calories. Too much time spent in sedentary activities, such as watching television or playing video games, also contributes to the problem. - Family factors. If your child comes from a family of overweight people, he or she may be more likely to put on weight. This is especially true in an environment where high-calorie foods are always available and physical activity isn&apos;t encouraged. - Psychological factors. Personal, parental and family stress can increase a child&apos;s risk of obesity. Some children overeat to cope with problems or to deal with emotions, such as stress, or to fight boredom. Their parents may have similar tendencies. - Socioeconomic factors. People in some communities have limited resources and limited access to supermarkets. As a result, they may opt for convenience foods that don&apos;t spoil quickly, such as frozen meals, crackers and cookies. In addition, people who live in lower income neighborhoods might not have access to a safe place to exercise. Childhood obesity can have complications for your child&apos;s physical, social and emotional well-being. Physical complications - Type 2 diabetes. This chronic condition affects the way your child&apos;s body uses sugar (glucose). Obesity and a sedentary lifestyle increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. - Metabolic syndrome. This cluster of conditions can put your child at risk of heart disease, diabetes or other health problems. Conditions include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high triglycerides, low HDL (&quot;good&quot;) cholesterol and excess abdominal fat. - High cholesterol and high blood pressure. A poor diet can cause your child to develop one or both of these conditions. These factors can contribute to the buildup of plaques in the arteries. These plaques can cause arteries to narrow and harden, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke later in life. - Asthma. Children who are overweight or obese might be more likely to have asthma. - Sleep disorders. Obstructive sleep apnea is a potentially serious disorder in which a child&apos;s breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This disorder, which usually causes no symptoms, causes fatty deposits to build up in the liver. NAFLD can lead to scarring and liver damage. Social and emotional complications - Low self-esteem and being bullied. Children often tease or bully their overweight peers, who suffer a loss of self-esteem and an increased risk of depression as a result. - Behavior and learning problems. Overweight children tend to have more anxiety and poorer social skills than normal-weight children do. These problems might lead children who are overweight to act out and disrupt their classrooms at one extreme, or to withdraw socially at the other. - Depression. Low self-esteem can create overwhelming feelings of hopelessness, which can lead to depression in some children who are overweight. As part of regular well-child care, the doctor calculates your child&apos;s BMI and determines where it falls on the BMI-for-age growth chart. The BMI helps indicate if your child is overweight for his or her age and height. Using the growth chart, your doctor determines your child&apos;s percentile, meaning how your child compares with other children of the same sex and age. For example, if your child is in the 80th percentile, it means that compared with other children of the same sex and age, 80 percent have a lower weight or BMI. Cutoff points on these growth charts, established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, help identify children who are overweight and obese: - BMI between 85th and 94th percentiles - overweight - BMI 95th percentile or above - obesity Because BMI doesn&apos;t consider things such as being muscular or having a larger than average body frame and because growth patterns vary greatly among children, your doctor also factors in your child&apos;s growth and development. This helps determine whether your child&apos;s weight is a health concern. In addition to BMI and charting weight on the growth charts, the doctor evaluates: - Your family&apos;s history of obesity and weight-related health problems, such as diabetes - Your child&apos;s eating habits - Your child&apos;s activity level - Other health conditions your child may have - Psychosocial history, including incidences of depression and sleep disturbances and sadness and whether your child has friends or is the target of bullying Blood tests Your child&apos;s doctor might order blood tests if he or she finds that your child is obese. These tests might include: - A cholesterol test - A blood sugar test - Other blood tests to check for hormone imbalances, vitamin D deficiency or other conditions associated with obesity Some of these tests require that your child not eat or drink anything before the test. Ask if your child needs to fast before a blood test and for how long. Treatment for childhood obesity is based on your child&apos;s age and if he or she has other medical conditions. Treatment usually includes changes in your child&apos;s eating habits and physical activity level. In certain circumstances, treatment might include medications or weight-loss surgery. Treatment for children who are overweight The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children older than 2 and adolescents whose weight falls in the overweight category be put on a weight-maintenance program to slow the progress of weight gain. This strategy allows the child to add inches in height but not pounds, causing BMI to drop over time into a healthier range. Treatment for children who are obese Children ages 6 to 11 who are obese might be encouraged to modify their eating habits for gradual weight loss of no more than 1 pound (or about 0.5 kilogram) a month. Older children and adolescents who are obese or severely obese might be encouraged to modify their eating habits to aim for weight loss of up to 2 pounds (or about 1 kilogram) a week. The methods for maintaining your child&apos;s current weight or losing weight are the same: Your child needs to eat a healthy diet - both in terms of type and amount of food - and increase physical activity. Success depends largely on your commitment to helping your child make these changes. Healthy eating Parents are the ones who buy groceries, cook meals and decide where the food is eaten. Even small changes can make a big difference in your child&apos;s health. - When food shopping, choose fruits and vegetables. Cut back on convenience foods - such as cookies, crackers and prepared meals - which are often high in sugar, fat and calories. Always have healthy snacks available. - Limit sweetened beverages. This includes those that contain fruit juice. These drinks provide little nutritional value in exchange for their high calories. They also can make your child feel too full to eat healthier foods. - Limit fast food. Many of the menu options are high in fat and calories. - Sit down together for family meals. Make it an event - a time to share news and tell stories. Discourage eating in front of a TV, computer or video game screen, which can lead to fast eating and lowered awareness of amount eaten. - Serve appropriate portion sizes. Children don&apos;t need as much food as adults do. Allow your child to eat until he or she is full, even if that means leaving food on the plate. And remember, when you eat out, restaurant portion sizes are often significantly oversized. Physical activity A critical part of achieving and maintaining a healthy weight, especially for children, is physical activity. It burns calories, strengthens bones and muscles, and helps children sleep well at night and stay alert during the day. Good habits established in childhood help adolescents maintain healthy weights despite the hormonal changes, rapid growth and social influences that often lead to overeating. And active children are more likely to become fit adults. To increase your child&apos;s activity level: - Limit TV and recreational computer time. Time spent watching television or using computers, smartphones or tablets is known as screen time. Children younger than 18 months should avoid all screen time, except for video-chatting with family and friends. For older preschooolers, limit screen use to 1 hour per day of high-quality programming. - Emphasize activity, not exercise. Children should be moderately to vigorously active for at least an hour a day. Your child&apos;s activity doesn&apos;t have to be a structured exercise program - the object is to get him or her moving. Free-play activities - such as playing hide-and-seek, tag or jump-rope - can be great for burning calories and improving fitness. - Find activities your child likes. For instance, if your child is artistically inclined, go on a nature hike to collect leaves and rocks that your child can use to make a collage. If your child likes to climb, head for the nearest neighborhood jungle gym or climbing wall. If your child likes to read, then walk or bike to the neighborhood library for a book. Medications Medication might be prescribed for some adolescents as part of an overall weight-loss plan. The risks of taking a prescription medication over the long term are unknown, and the medication&apos;s effect on weight loss and weight maintenance for adolescents is still in question. Weight-loss surgery Weight-loss surgery may be an option for severely obese adolescents who have been unable to lose weight through lifestyle changes. However, as with any type of surgery, there are potential risks and long-term complications. Also, the long-term effects of weight-loss surgery on future growth and development are largely unknown. Weight-loss surgery in adolescents is uncommon. But your doctor might recommend this surgery if your child&apos;s weight poses a greater health threat than do the potential risks of surgery. It&apos;s important that a child being considered for weight-loss surgery meet with a team of pediatric specialists, including a pediatric endocrinologist, psychologist and dietitian. Weight-loss surgery isn&apos;t a miracle cure. It doesn&apos;t guarantee that an adolescent will lose all of his or her excess weight or be able to keep it off long term. And surgery doesn&apos;t replace the need for a healthy diet and regular physical activity. Addressing a woman&apos;s health and weight before she conceives could lead to improvements in childhood obesity. If you&apos;re overweight and thinking of becoming pregnant, losing weight and eating well might affect your child&apos;s future. Eating well throughout pregnancy might also have a positive impact on your baby&apos;s later food choices. To give your infant a healthy start, the World Health Organization recommends exclusively breast-feeding for 6 months. If your child is overweight or obese, his or her best chance to achieve and maintain a healthy weight is to start eating a healthy diet and exercising more. Here are some steps you can take at home to help your child succeed: - Be a role model. Choose healthy foods and active pastimes for yourself. If you need to lose weight, doing so will motivate your child to do likewise. - Involve the whole family. Make healthy eating a priority and emphasize how important it is for everyone to be physically active. This avoids singling out the child who is overweight.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Health risks of obesity: Obesity is a medical condition in which a high amount of body fat increases the chance of developing medical problems. People with obesity have a higher chance of developing these health problems: - High blood glucose (sugar) or diabetes. - High blood pressure (hypertension). - High blood cholesterol and triglycerides (dyslipidemia or high blood fats). - Heart attacks due to coronary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke. - Bone and joint problems, more weight puts pressure on the bones and joints. This can lead to osteoarthritis, a disease that causes joint pain and stiffness. - Stopping breathing during sleep (sleep apnea). This can cause daytime fatigue or sleepiness, poor attention, and problems at work. - Gallstones and liver problems. - Some cancers Three things can be used to determine if a person&apos;s body fat gives them a higher chance of developing obesity-related diseases: - Body mass index (BMI) - Waist size - Other risk factors the person has (a risk factor is anything that increases your chance of getting a disease.) Body mass index (BMI) is calculated using height and weight. It is used to estimate body fat. Starting at 25.0, the higher your BMI, the greater is your risk of developing obesity-related health problems. These ranges of BMI are used to describe levels of risk: - Overweight (not obese), if BMI is 25.0 to 29.9 - Class 1 (low-risk) obesity, if BMI is 30.0 to 34.9 - Class 2 (moderate-risk) obesity, if BMI is 35.0 to 39.9 - Class 3 (high-risk) obesity, if BMI is equal to or greater than 40.0 Women with a waist size greater than 35 inches (89 centimeters) and men with a waist size greater than 40 inches (102 centimeters) have an increased risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. People with &quot;apple-shaped&quot; bodies (waist is bigger than the hips) also have an increased risk of these conditions. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get the disease. But it does increase the chance that you will. Some risk factors, like age, race, or family history cannot be changed. The more risk factors you have, the more likely it is that you will develop the disease or health problem. Your risk of developing health problems such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems increases if you are obese and have these risk factors: - High blood pressure (hypertension) - High blood cholesterol or triglycerides - High blood glucose (sugar), a sign of type 2 diabetes These other risk factors for heart disease and stroke are not caused by obesity: - Having a family member under the age of 50 with heart disease - Being physically inactive or having a sedentary lifestyle - Smoking or using tobacco products of any kind You can control many of these risk factors by changing your lifestyle. If you have obesity, your doctor can help you begin a weight-loss program. A starting goal of losing 5 to 10% of your current weight will reduce your risk of developing obesity-related diseases.

				<AnswerText>Prescription Medications to Treat Overweight and Obesity (What are overweight and obesity?): Health care providers use the Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a measure of your weight in relation to your height, to define overweight and obesity. People who have a BMI between 25 and 30 are considered overweight. Obesity is defined as having a BMI of 30 or greater. You can calculate your BMI to learn if you are overweight or obese. Being overweight or obese may increase the risk of health problems. Your health care provider can assess your individual risk due to your weight.Obesity is a chronic condition that affects more than one in three adults in the United States. Another one in three adults is overweight. If you are struggling with your weight, you may find that a healthy eating plan and regular physical activity help you lose weight and keep it off over the long term. If these lifestyle changes are not enough to help you lose weight or maintain your weight loss, your doctor may prescribe medications as part of your weight-control program.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What causes Obesity?: Taking in more calories than your body burns can lead to obesity. This is because the body stores unused calories as fat. Obesity can be caused by: - Eating more food than your body can use - Drinking too much alcohol - Not getting enough exercise Many obese people who lose large amounts of weight and gain it back think it is their fault. They blame themselves for not having the willpower to keep the weight off. Many people regain more weight than they lost. Today, we know that biology is a big reason why some people cannot keep the weight off. Some people who live in the same place and eat the same foods become obese, while others do not. Our bodies have a complex system to keep our weight at a healthy level. In some people, this system does not work normally. The way we eat when we are children can affect the way we eat as adults. The way we eat over many years becomes a habit. It affects what we eat, when we eat, and how much we eat. We may feel that we are surrounded by things that make it easy to overeat and hard to stay active. - Many people feel they do not have time to plan and make healthy meals. - More people today work desk jobs compared to more active jobs in the past. - People with little free time may have less time to exercise. The term eating disorder means a group of medical conditions that have an unhealthy focus on eating, dieting, losing or gaining weight, and body image. A person may be obese, follow an unhealthy diet, and have an eating disorder all at the same time. Sometimes, medical problems or treatments cause weight gain, including: - Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) - Medicines such as birth control pills, antidepressants, and antipsychotics Other things that can cause weight gain are: - Quitting smoking. Many people who quit smoking gain 4 to 10 pounds in the first 6 months after quitting. - Stress, anxiety, feeling sad, or not sleeping well - Menopause. Women may gain 12 to 15 pounds during menopause. - Pregnancy. Women may not lose the weight they gained during pregnancy.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Obesity (Summary): Summary Obesity means having too much body fat. It is different from being overweight, which means weighing too much. The weight may come from muscle, bone, fat, and/or body water. Both terms mean that a person&apos;s weight is greater than what&apos;s considered healthy for his or her height. Obesity happens over time when you eat more calories than you use. The balance between calories-in and calories-out differs for each person. Factors that might affect your weight include your genetic makeup, overeating, eating high-fat foods, and not being physically active. Obesity increases your risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, and some cancers. If you have obesity, losing even 5 to 10 percent of your weight can delay or prevent some of these diseases. For example, that means losing 10 to 20 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds.

				<AnswerText>Obesity (Causes): Although there are genetic, behavioral and hormonal influences on body weight, obesity occurs when you take in more calories than you burn through exercise and normal daily activities. Your body stores these excess calories as fat. Obesity can sometimes be traced to a medical cause, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Cushing&apos;s syndrome, and other diseases and conditions. However, these disorders are rare and, in general, the principal causes of obesity are: - Inactivity. If you&apos;re not very active, you don&apos;t burn as many calories. With a sedentary lifestyle, you can easily take in more calories every day than you use through exercise and normal daily activities. - Unhealthy diet and eating habits. Weight gain is inevitable if you regularly eat more calories than you burn. And most Americans&apos; diets are too high in calories and are full of fast food and high-calorie beverages.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Obesity (Risk factors): Obesity usually results from a combination of causes and contributing factors, including: - Genetics. Your genes may affect the amount of body fat you store, and where that fat is distributed. Genetics may also play a role in how efficiently your body converts food into energy and how your body burns calories during exercise. - Family lifestyle. Obesity tends to run in families. If one or both of your parents are obese, your risk of being obese is increased. That&apos;s not just because of genetics. Family members tend to share similar eating and activity habits. - Inactivity. If you&apos;re not very active, you don&apos;t burn as many calories. With a sedentary lifestyle, you can easily take in more calories every day than you burn through exercise and routine daily activities. Having medical problems, such as arthritis, can lead to decreased activity, which contributes to weight gain. - Unhealthy diet. A diet that&apos;s high in calories, lacking in fruits and vegetables, full of fast food, and laden with high-calorie beverages and oversized portions contributes to weight gain. - Medical problems. In some people, obesity can be traced to a medical cause, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Cushing&apos;s syndrome and other conditions. Medical problems, such as arthritis, also can lead to decreased activity, which may result in weight gain. - Certain medications. Some medications can lead to weight gain if you don&apos;t compensate through diet or activity. These medications include some antidepressants, anti-seizure medications, diabetes medications, antipsychotic medications, steroids and beta blockers. - Social and economic issues. Research has linked social and economic factors to obesity. Avoiding obesity is difficult if you don&apos;t have safe areas to exercise. Similarly, you may not have been taught healthy ways of cooking, or you may not have money to buy healthier foods. In addition, the people you spend time with may influence your weight - you&apos;re more likely to become obese if you have obese friends or relatives. - Age. Obesity can occur at any age, even in young children. But as you age, hormonal changes and a less active lifestyle increase your risk of obesity. In addition, the amount of muscle in your body tends to decrease with age. This lower muscle mass leads to a decrease in metabolism. These changes also reduce calorie needs, and can make it harder to keep off excess weight. If you don&apos;t consciously control what you eat and become more physically active as you age, you&apos;ll likely gain weight. - Pregnancy. During pregnancy, a woman&apos;s weight necessarily increases. Some women find this weight difficult to lose after the baby is born. This weight gain may contribute to the development of obesity in women. - Quitting smoking. Quitting smoking is often associated with weight gain. And for some, it can lead to enough weight gain that the person becomes obese. In the long run, however, quitting smoking is still a greater benefit to your health than continuing to smoke. - Lack of sleep. Not getting enough sleep or getting too much sleep can cause changes in hormones that increase your appetite. You may also crave foods high in calories and carbohydrates, which can contribute to weight gain. Even if you have one or more of these risk factors, it doesn&apos;t mean that you&apos;re destined to become obese. You can counteract most risk factors through diet, physical activity and exercise, and behavior changes.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (Signs and Symptoms): Many of the signs and symptoms of obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) are the same as those of obstructive sleep apnea. This is because many people who have OHS also have obstructive sleep apnea. One of the most common signs of obstructive sleep apnea is loud and chronic (ongoing) snoring. Pauses may occur in the snoring. Choking or gasping may follow the pauses. Other symptoms include: Daytime sleepiness Morning headaches Memory, learning, or concentration problems Feeling irritable or depressed, or having mood swings or personality changes You also may have rapid, shallow breathing. During a physical exam, your doctor might hear abnormal heart sounds while listening to your heart with a stethoscope. He or she also might notice that the opening to your throat is small and your neck is larger than normal. Complications of Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome When left untreated, OHS can cause serious problems, such as: Leg edema, which is swelling in the legs caused by fluid in the body&apos;s tissues. Pulmonary hypertension, which is increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries. These arteries carry blood from your heart to your lungs to pick up oxygen. Cor pulmonale, which is failure of the right side of the heart. Secondary erythrocytosis, which is a condition in which the body makes too many red blood cells.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Overweight and Obesity (Signs, Symptoms, and Complications): There are no specific symptoms of overweight and obesity. The signs of overweight and obesity include a high body mass index (BMI) and an unhealthy body fat distribution that can be estimated by measuring your waist circumference. Obesity can cause complications in many parts of your body.   High body mass index (BMI) A high BMI is the most common sign of overweight and obesity. Unhealthy body fat distribution Another sign of overweight and obesity is having an unhealthy body fat distribution. Fatty tissue is found in different parts of your body and has many functions. Having an increased waist circumference suggests that you have increased amounts of fat in your abdomen. An increased waist circumference is a sign of obesity and can increase your risk for obesity-related complications. Read more Did you know that fatty tissue has different functions depending on its location in your body? Visceral fat is the fatty tissue inside of your abdomen and organs. While we do not know what causes the body to create and store visceral fat, it is known that this type of fat interferes with the body’s endocrine and immune systems and promotes chronic inflammation and contributes to obesity-related complications. Complications Obesity may cause the following complications: Metabolic Syndrome Type 2 diabetes High blood cholesterol and high triglyceride levels in the blood Diseases of the heart and blood vessels such as high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, heart attacks and stroke Respiratory problems such as obstructive sleep apnea , asthma, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome Back pain   Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) Osteoarthritis, a chronic inflammation that damages the cartilage and bone in or around the affected joint. It can cause mild or severe pain and usually affects weight-bearing joints in people who are obese. It is a major cause of knee replacement surgery in patients who are obese for a long time. Urinary incontinence, the unintentional leakage of urine. Chronic obesity can weaken pelvic muscles, making it harder to maintain bladder control. While it can happen to both sexes, it usually affects women as they age. Gallbladder disease Emotional health issues such as low self-esteem or depression. This may commonly occur in children. Cancers of the esophagus, pancreas, colon, rectum, kidney, endometrium, ovaries, gallbladder, breast, or liver. Read more Did you know inflammation is thought to play a role in the onset of certain obesity-related complications? Researchers now know more about visceral fat, which is deep in the abdomen of overweight and obese patients. Visceral fat releases factors that promote inflammation. Chronic obesity-related inflammation is thought to lead to insulin resistance and diabetes, changes in the liver or non-alcoholic fatty acid liver disease, and cancers. More research is needed to understand what triggers inflammation in some obese patients and to find new treatments. Look for Diagnosis will explain tests and procedures used to detect signs of overweight and obesity and help rule our other conditions that may be causing weight gain. Treatment will discuss treatment-related complications or side effects.

				<AnswerText>Symptoms and Causes of Diabetes: Symptoms of diabetes includeincreased thirst and urination increased hunger fatigue blurred vision numbness or tingling in the feet or hands sores that do not heal unexplained weight lossSymptoms of type 1 diabetes can start quickly, in a matter of weeks. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly—over the course of several years—and can be so mild that you might not even notice them. Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms. Some people do not find out they have the disease until they have diabetes-related health problems, such as blurred vision or heart trouble. Type 1 diabetes occurs when your immune system, the body’s system for fighting infection, attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. Scientists think type 1 diabetes is caused by genes and environmental factors, such as viruses, that might trigger the disease. Studies such as TrialNet are working to pinpoint causes of type 1 diabetes and possible ways to prevent or slow the disease. Type 2 diabetes—the most common form of diabetes—is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes.Overweight, obesity, and physical inactivityYou are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you are not physically active and are overweight or obese. Extra weight sometimes causes insulin resistance and is common in people with type 2 diabetes. The location of body fat also makes a difference. Extra belly fat is linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and heart and blood vessel disease. To see if your weight puts you at risk for type 2 diabetes, check out these Body Mass Index (BMI) charts.Insulin resistanceType 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which muscle, liver, and fat cells do not use insulin well. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells. At first, the pancreas makes more insulin to keep up with the added demand. Over time, the pancreas can’t make enough insulin, and blood glucose levels rise.Genes and family historyAs in type 1 diabetes, certain genes may make you more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. The disease tends to run in families and occurs more often in these racial/ethnic groups:African Americans Alaska Natives American Indians Asian Americans Hispanics/Latinos Native Hawaiians Pacific IslandersGenes also can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes by increasing a person’s tendency to become overweight or obese. Scientists believe gestational diabetes, a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors.Insulin resistanceHormones produced by the placenta contribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Most pregnant women can produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, but some cannot. Gestational diabetes occurs when the pancreas can’t make enough insulin.As with type 2 diabetes, extra weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Women who are overweight or obese may already have insulin resistance when they become pregnant. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also be a factor.Hormonal changes, extra weight, and family history can contribute to gestational diabetes.Genes and family historyHaving a family history of diabetes makes it more likely that a woman will develop gestational diabetes, which suggests that genes play a role. Genes may also explain why the disorder occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asians, and Hispanics/Latinas. Genetic mutations, other diseases, damage to the pancreas, and certain medicines may also cause diabetes.Genetic mutationsMonogenic diabetes is caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These changes are usually passed through families, but sometimes the gene mutation happens on its own. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by making the pancreas less able to make insulin. The most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Neonatal diabetes occurs in the first 6 months of life. Doctors usually diagnose MODY during adolescence or early adulthood, but sometimes the disease is not diagnosed until later in life. Cystic fibrosis produces thick mucus that causes scarring in the pancreas. This scarring can prevent the pancreas from making enough insulin. Hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. If the disease is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.Hormonal diseasesSome hormonal diseases cause the body to produce too much of certain hormones, which sometimes cause insulin resistance and diabetes.Cushing’s syndrome occurs when the body produces too much cortisol—often called the “stress hormone.” Acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone.Damage to or removal of the pancreasPancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and trauma can all harm the beta cells or make them less able to produce insulin, resulting in diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.MedicinesSometimes certain medicines can harm beta cells or disrupt the way insulin works. These includeniacin, a type of vitamin B3 certain types of diuretics, also called water pills anti-seizure drugs psychiatric drugs drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pentamidine, a drug used to treat a type of pneumonia glucocorticoids—medicines used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, and ulcerative colitis anti-rejection medicines, used to help stop the body from rejecting a transplanted organStatins, which are medicines to reduce LDL (“bad”) cholesterol levels, can slightly increase the chance that you’ll develop diabetes. However, statins help protect you from heart disease and stroke. For this reason, the strong benefits of taking statins outweigh the small chance that you could develop diabetes.If you take any of these medicines and are concerned about their side effects, talk with your doctor.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Myopathy with extrapyramidal signs: Myopathy with extrapyramidal signs is a disorder characterized by early childhood onset of proximal muscle weakness (muscles closest to the body’s midline) and learning disabilities. The muscle weakness does not progress, but most patients develop progressive atypical involuntary muscle contractions that influence gait, movement, and posture (extrapyramidal signs) that may be disabling. Signs and symptoms are variable and include brief, repetitive, jerky and uncontrolled movements caused by muscle contractions ( chorea), tremor, abnormal posturing, and involuntary repetitive movements of the mouth and face. [1]  Other symptoms may include uncoordinated movements ( ataxia ), a very small head ( microcephaly ), drooping of the eyelids, wasting of the eye nerve ( optic atrophy), and axonal peripheral neuropathy. It is caused by changes ( mutations ) in the MICU1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive   pattern. [1] [2] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Ataxia Occasional Microcephaly Occasional Ophthalmoplegia Occasional Optic atrophy Occasional Peripheral axonal neuropathy Occasional Ptosis Occasional Abnormality of extrapyramidal motor function Very rare Chorea Very rare Dystonia Very rare Orofacial dyskinesia Very rare Proximal muscle weakness Very rare Specific learning disability Very rare Tremor Very rare Autosomal recessive inheritance - Difficulty running - Difficulty walking - Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase - Motor delay - View complete list of signs and symptoms...</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Warning signs and symptoms of heart disease: Heart disease often develops over time. You may have early signs or symptoms long before you have serious heart problems. Or you may not realize you are developing heart disease. The warning signs of heart disease may not be obvious. Also, not every person has the same symptoms. Certain symptoms, such as chest pain, ankle swelling, and shortness of breath may be signals that something is wrong. Learning the warning signs can help you get treatment and help prevent a heart attack or stroke. Chest pain is discomfort or pain that you feel along the front of your body, between your neck and upper abdomen. There are many causes of chest pain that have nothing to do with your heart. But chest pain is still the most common symptom of poor blood flow to the heart or a heart attack. This type of chest pain is called angina. Chest pain can occur when the heart is not getting enough blood or oxygen. The amount and type of pain can vary from person to person. The intensity of the pain does not always relate to how severe the problem is. - Some people may feel a crushing pain, while others feel only mild discomfort. - Your chest may feel heavy or like someone is squeezing your heart. You may also feel a sharp, burning pain in your chest. - You may feel the pain under your breastbone (sternum), or in your neck, arms, stomach, jaw, or upper back. - Chest pain from angina often occurs with activity or emotion, and goes away with rest or a medicine called nitroglycerin. - Bad indigestion can also cause chest pain. Women, older adults, and people with diabetes may have little or no chest pain. They are more likely to have symptoms other than chest pain, such as: - Fatigue - Shortness of breath - General weakness - Change in skin color or greyish pallor (episodes of change in skin color associated with weakness) Other symptoms of a heart attack can include: - Extreme anxiety - Fainting or loss of consciousness - Lightheadedness or dizziness - Nausea or vomiting - Palpitations (feeling like your heart is beating too fast or irregularly) - Shortness of breath - Sweating, which may be very heavy When the heart can&apos;t pump blood as well as it should, blood backs up in the veins that go from the lungs to the heart. Fluid leaks into the lungs and causes shortness of breath. This is a symptom of heart failure. You may notice shortness of breath: - During activity - While you&apos;re resting - When you&apos;re lying flat on your back -- it may even wake you from sleep Coughing or wheezing that doesn&apos;t go away can be another sign that fluid is building up in your lungs. You may also cough up mucus that is pink or bloody. Swelling (edema) in your lower legs is another sign of a heart problem. When your heart doesn&apos;t work as well, blood flow slows and backs up in the veins in your legs. This causes fluid to build up in your tissues. You may also have swelling in your stomach or notice some weight gain. Narrowing of the blood vessels that bring blood to other parts of the body may mean you have a much higher risk for heart attack. It can occur when cholesterol and other fatty material (plaque) build up on the walls of your arteries. Poor blood supply to the legs may lead to: - Pain, achiness, fatigue, burning, or discomfort in the muscles of your feet, calves, or thighs. - Symptoms that often appear during walking or exercise, and go away after several minutes of rest. - Numbness in your legs or feet when you are at rest. Your legs may also feel cool to the touch, and the skin may look pale. A stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain stops. A stroke is sometimes called a &quot;brain attack.&quot; Symptoms of stroke can include difficulty moving the limbs on one side of your body, one side of the face drooping, difficulty with speaking or understanding language. Tiredness can have many causes. Often it simply means that you need more rest. But feeling run down can be a sign of a more serious problem. Fatigue may be a sign of heart trouble when: - You feel much more tired than normal. It&apos;s common for women to feel severely tired before or during a heart attack. - You feel so tired that you can&apos;t do your normal daily activities. - You have sudden, severe weakness. If your heart can&apos;t pump blood as well, it may beat faster to try to keep up. You may feel your heart racing or throbbing. A fast or uneven heartbeat can also be the sign of an arrhythmia. This is a problem with your heart rate or rhythm. If you have any signs of heart disease, call your health care provider right away. Don&apos;t wait to see if the symptoms go away or dismiss them as nothing. Call your local emergency number (such as 911) if: - You have chest pain or other symptoms of a heart attack - If you know you have angina and have chest pain that doesn&apos;t go away after 5 minutes of rest or after taking nitroglycerine - If you think you may be having a heart attack - If you become extremely short of breath - If you think you may have lost consciousness Updated by: Michael A.

				<AnswerText>Common symptoms during pregnancy: Growing a baby is hard work. Your body will go through a lot of changes as your baby grows and your hormones change. Along with the aches and pains of pregnancy, you will feel other new or changing symptoms. Even so, many pregnant women say that they feel healthier than ever. Being tired is common during pregnancy. Most women feel tired the first few months, then again toward the end. Exercise, rest, and a proper diet can make you feel less tired. It may also help to take rest breaks or naps every day. Early on in the pregnancy, you will likely be making more trips to the bathroom. - As your uterus grows and rises higher in your abdomen (belly), the need to urinate often may lessen. - Even so, you will continue to urinate more throughout pregnancy. That means that you also need to drink more water, and may be thirstier than before you were pregnant. - As you get closer to delivery and your baby descends into your pelvis, you will need to pee much more, and the amount of urine passed at one time will be less (the bladder holds less due to pressure from the baby). If you have pain when you urinate or a change in urine odor or color, call your health care provider. These could be signs of a bladder infection. Some pregnant women also leak urine when they cough or sneeze. For most women, this goes away after the baby is born. If this happens to you, start doing Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles of your pelvic floor. You may see more vaginal discharge while pregnant. Call your provider if the discharge: - Has a foul odor - Has a greenish color - Makes you feel itchy - Causes pain or soreness Having a hard time moving the bowels is normal during pregnancy. This is because: - Hormone changes during pregnancy slow down your digestive system. - Later in your pregnancy, the pressure from your uterus on your rectum may also worsen the problem. You can ease constipation by: - Eating raw fruits and vegetables, such as prunes, to get extra fiber. - Eating whole grain or bran cereals for more fiber. - Using a fiber supplement regularly. - Drinking plenty of water (8 to 9 cups daily). Ask your provider about trying a stool softener. Also ask before using laxatives during pregnancy. While you are pregnant, food stays in your stomach and bowels longer. This may cause heartburn (stomach acid moving back up into the esophagus). You can reduce heartburn by: - Eating small meals - Avoiding spicy and greasy foods - Not drinking large amounts of liquid before bedtime - Not exercising for at least 2 hours after you eat - Not lying down flat right after a meal If you continue to have heartburn, talk to your provider about medicines that can help. Some women have nose and gum bleeding while they are pregnant. This is because the tissues in their nose and gums get dry, and the blood vessels dilate and are closer to the surface. You can avoid or reduce this bleeding by: - Drinking lots of fluids - Getting lots of vitamin C, from orange juice or other fruits and juices - Using a humidifier (a device that puts water in the air) to decrease dryness of the nose or sinuses - Brushing your teeth with a soft toothbrush to decrease bleeding gums - Maintaining good dental hygiene and using floss every day to keep your gums healthy Swelling in your legs is common. You may see more swelling as you get closer to giving birth. The swelling is caused by your uterus pressing on the veins. - You may also notice that the veins in your lower body are becoming larger. - In the legs, these are called varicose veins. - You may also have veins close to your vulva and vagina that swell. - In your rectum, veins that swell are called hemorrhoids. To reduce swelling: - Raise your legs and rest your feet on a surface higher than your belly. - Lie on your side in bed. Lying on the left side is better if you can do it comfortably. It also provides better circulation for the baby. - Wear support pantyhose or compression stockings. - Limit salty foods. Salt works like a sponge and makes your body hold more water. - Try not to strain during bowel movements. This can worsen hemorrhoids. Leg swelling that occurs with headaches or high blood pressure can be a sign of a serious medical complication of pregnancy called preeclampsia. It is important to discuss leg swelling with your provider. Some women feel short of breath at times while they are pregnant. It happens more often in the early part of the pregnancy due to the changes in your hormones. It may also happen again toward the end of your pregnancy because of pressure from the baby. Mild shortness of breath from exercise that quickly gets better is not serious. Severe chest pain or shortness of breath that does not go away can be a sign of a serious medical complication. Call 911 or go to an emergency room right away if you have these symptoms. You may get short of breath again in the later weeks of pregnancy. This is because the uterus takes up so much room that your lungs do not have as much space to expand. Doing these things might help with shortness of breath: - Sitting up straight - Sleeping propped up on a pillow - Resting when you feel short of breath - Moving at a slower pace If you suddenly have a hard time breathing that is unusual for you, see your provider right away or go to the emergency room.

				<AnswerText>Overweight and Obesity (Treatment): Treatment for overweight and obesity depends on the cause and severity of your condition. Possible treatments include healthy lifestyle changes, behavioral weight-loss treatment programs, medicines, and possibly surgery. You may need treatments for any complications that you have. Healthy lifestyle changes To help you aim for and maintain a healthy weight, your doctor may recommend that you adopt lifelong healthy lifestyle changes. Heart-healthy eating. Learn about which foods and nutrients are part of a healthy eating pattern. It’s important to eat the right amount of calories to maintain a healthy weight. If you need to lose weight, try to reduce your total daily calories gradually. Use the Body Weight Planner to find out your daily calorie needs and to set goals. Visit healthy recipes and plan for success. Talk with your doctor before beginning any diet or eating plan. Visit Chose My Plate or 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans for more information. Physical activity. Many health benefits are associated with physical activity and getting the recommended amount of physical activity needed each week. Physical activity is an important factor in determining whether a person can maintain a healthy body weight, lose excess body weight, or maintain successful weight loss. Before starting any exercise program, ask your doctor about what level of physical activity is right for you. Visit Physical Activity Has Many Health Benefits for more information. Healthy Sleep. Studies have shown some relationship between lack of sleep and obesity. Read Sleep Deprivation and Deficiency more information. Making lifelong healthy lifestyle changes, such as heart-healthy eating and physical activity, can help you modify your energy balance to help you aim for and maintain a healthy weight. For example: To aim for a healthy weight, or lose weight, you want your energy OUT to be more than your energy IN. To maintain weight loss you want your energy IN and energy OUT to be the same.  Behavioral weight-loss programs Your doctor may recommend you enroll in individual or group behavioral weight-loss programs to treat your overweight and obesity. In these programs, a trained healthcare professional will customize a weight-loss plan for you. This plan will include a moderately-reduced calorie diet, physical activity goals, and behavioral strategies to help you make and maintain these lifestyle changes. Read Living With for more information about required follow-up for these behavioral treatment programs. Read more Did you know your brain’s pleasure and reward centers can be stimulated by food and the act of eating, making it harder to change eating patterns and lose weight? Researchers know that our brains can become patterned so that we feel pleasure or reward from eating. This can make us unconsciously crave food so our bodies feel that sense of pleasure. It can also make it hard to change our eating patterns, lose weight, or maintain a healthy weight. Researchers are studying whether cognitive behavioral therapies can be an effective treatment for overweight and obesity by retraining the brain to not associate pleasure with food and the act of eating. Medicines When healthy lifestyle changes are not enough, your doctor may treat your overweight and obesity with FDA-approved medicines. These medicines work in the following parts of your body. Brain. Several medicines change the way the brain regulates the urge to eat, which can help to decrease appetite. Some examples of these medicines are diethylpropion, phendimetrazine, lorcaserin, naltrexone/bupropion, and liraglutide. Gastrointestinal tract. Orlistat is the only available medicine. It blocks your intestines from absorbing fat from foods in your diet. Weight loss medicines are not recommended as a single treatment for weight loss. These medicines can help you lose weight but when combined with lifestyle changes may result in greater weight loss. Some of these medicines should not be used if you have certain conditions or are taking certain medicines. Also, these medicines have side effects. Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant, planning to get pregnant, breast feeding, or have a family history of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack, or stroke. Surgical procedures Some patients with obesity do not respond to healthy lifestyle changes and medicines. When these patients develop certain obesity-related complications, they may be eligible for the following surgeries. Gastric bypass surgery. A small part of the stomach is connected to the middle part of the intestine, bypassing the first part of intestine. This decreases the amount of food that you can eat and the amount of fat your body can take in and store. Gastrectomy. A big portion of the stomach is removed to decrease the amount of food that you can eat. Gastric banding. A hollow band is placed around the upper part of the stomach creating a smaller stomach. This decreases the amount of food you can eat. Talk to your doctor to learn more about the benefits and risks of each type of surgery. Possible complications include bleeding, infection, internal rupture of sutures, or even death. Read gastric bypass surgery for more information. Read more Interested in learning why these surgeries lead to weight loss in some patients? First, these surgeries reduce the amount of food stored in the stomach and the amount of calories your body can take in. This can help your body restore energy balance. Second, these surgeries change the levels of certain hormones and the way the brain responds to these hormones to control hunger urges. After surgery, some people are less interested in eating or they prefer to eat healthier foods. In some cases, genetic differences may affect how much weight loss patients experience after bariatric surgery. Look for Living With will explain recommendations that your doctor may give, including lifelong healthy lifestyle changes and medical care to prevent your condition from recurring, getting worse, or causing complications. Research for Your Health will explain how we are using current research and advancing research to treat people with overweight and obesity. Participate in NHLBI Clinical Trials will discuss our ongoing clinical studies that are investigating treatments for overweight and obesity.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What are the treatments for Obesity?: CHANGING YOUR LIFESTYLE An active lifestyle and plenty of exercise, along with healthy eating, is the safest way to lose weight. Even modest weight loss can improve your health. You may need a lot of support from family and friends. Your main goal should be to learn new, healthy ways of eating and make them part of your daily routine. Many people find it hard to change their eating habits and behaviors. You may have practiced some habits for so long that you may not even know they are unhealthy, or you do them without thinking. You need to be motivated to make lifestyle changes. Make the behavior change part of your life over the long term. Know that it takes time to make and keep a change in your lifestyle. Work with your health care provider and dietitian to set realistic, safe daily calorie counts that help you lose weight while staying healthy. Remember that if you drop pounds slowly and steadily, you are more likely to keep them off. Your dietitian can teach you about: - Healthy food choices - Healthy snacks - Reading nutrition labels - New ways to prepare food - Portion sizes - Sweetened drinks Extreme diets (fewer than 1,100 calories per day) are not thought to be safe or to work very well. These types of diets often do not contain enough vitamins and minerals. Most people who lose weight this way return to overeating and become obese again. Learn ways to manage stress other than snacking. Examples may be meditation, yoga, or exercise. If you are depressed or stressed a lot, talk to your provider. MEDICINES AND HERBAL REMEDIES You may see ads for supplements and herbal remedies that claim they will help you lose weight. Some of these claims may not be true. And some of these supplements can have serious side effects. Talk to your provider before using them. You can discuss weight loss medicines with your doctor. Many people lose at least 5 pounds by taking these drugs, but they may regain the weight when they stop taking the medicine unless they have made lifestyle changes. SURGERY Bariatric (weight-loss) surgery can reduce the risk of certain diseases in people with severe obesity. These risks include: - Arthritis - Diabetes - Heart disease - High blood pressure - Sleep apnea - Some cancers - Stroke Surgery may help people who have been very obese for 5 years or more and have not lost weight from other treatments, such as diet, exercise, or medicine. Surgery alone is not the answer for weight loss. It can train you to eat less, but you still have to do much of the work. You must be committed to diet and exercise after surgery. Talk to your doctor to learn if surgery is a good option for you. Weight-loss surgeries include: - Laparoscopic gastric banding - Gastric bypass surgery - Sleeve gastrectomy (less common) - Duodenal switch</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Insulin, Medicines, and Other Diabetes Treatments (Do I have other treatment options for my diabetes?): When medicines and lifestyle changes are not enough to manage your diabetes, a less common treatment may be an option. Other treatments include bariatric surgery for certain people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and an &quot;artificial pancreas&quot; and pancreatic islet transplantation for some people with type 1 diabetes.Bariatric surgeryAlso called weight-loss surgery or metabolic surgery, bariatric surgery may help some people with obesity and type 2 diabetes lose a large amount of weight and regain normal blood glucose levels. Some people with diabetes may no longer need their diabetes medicine after bariatric surgery. Whether and for how long blood glucose levels improve seems to vary by the patient, type of weight-loss surgery, and amount of weight the person loses. Other factors include how long someone has had diabetes and whether or not the person uses insulin.1Recent research suggests that weight-loss surgery also may help improve blood glucose control in people with type 1 diabetes who are obese.2Researchers are studying the long-term results of bariatric surgery in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.Artificial PancreasThe NIDDK has played an important role in developing “artificial pancreas” technology. An artificial pancreas replaces manual blood glucose testing and the use of insulin shots or a pump. A single system monitors blood glucose levels around the clock and provides insulin or a combination of insulin and a second hormone, glucagon, automatically. The system can also be monitored remotely, for example by parents or medical staff.In 2016, the FDA approved a type of artificial pancreas system called a hybrid closed-loop system. This system tests your glucose level every 5 minutes throughout the day and night, and automatically gives you the right amount of insulin.You still need to manually adjust the amount of insulin the pump delivers at mealtimes. But, the artificial pancreas may free you from some of the daily tasks needed to keep your blood glucose stable—or help you sleep through the night without the need to wake and test your glucose or take medicine.The hybrid closed-loop system is expected to be available in the U.S. in 2017. Talk with your health care provider about whether this system might be right for you.The NIDDK has funded several important studies on different types of artificial pancreas devices to better help people with type 1 diabetes manage their disease. The devices may also help people with type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes.Pancreatic islet transplantationPancreatic islet transplantation is an experimental treatment for poorly controlled type 1 diabetes. Pancreatic islets are clusters of cells in the pancreas that make the hormone insulin. In type 1 diabetes, the body’s immune system attacks these cells. A pancreatic islet transplant replaces destroyed islets with new ones that make and release insulin. This procedure takes islets from the pancreas of an organ donor and transfers them to a person with type 1 diabetes. Because researchers are still studying pancreatic islet transplantation, the procedure is only available to people enrolled in research studies.

				<AnswerText>Obesity (Treatment): The goal of obesity treatment is to reach and stay at a healthy weight. You may need to work with a team of health professionals - including a dietitian, behavior counselor or an obesity specialist - to help you understand and make changes in your eating and activity habits. The initial treatment goal is usually a modest weight loss - 3 to 5 percent of your total weight. That means that if you weigh 200 pounds (91 kg) and are obese by BMI standards, you would need to lose only about 6 to 10 pounds (2.7 to 4.5 kg) for your health to begin to improve. However, the more weight you lose, the greater the benefits. All weight-loss programs require changes in your eating habits and increased physical activity. The treatment methods that are right for you depend on your level of obesity, your overall health and your willingness to participate in your weight-loss plan. Other treatment tools include: - Dietary changes - Exercise and activity - Behavior change - Prescription weight-loss medications - Weight-loss surgery Dietary changes Reducing calories and practicing healthier eating habits are vital to overcoming obesity. Although you may lose weight quickly at first, slow and steady weight loss over the long term is considered the safest way to lose weight and the best way to keep it off permanently. Avoid drastic and unrealistic diet changes, such as crash diets, because they&apos;re unlikely to help you keep excess weight off for the long term. Plan to participate in a comprehensive weight-loss program for at least six months and in the maintenance phase of a program for at least a year to boost your odds of weight-loss success. There is no best weight-loss diet. Choose one that includes healthy foods that you feel will work for you. Dietary changes to treat obesity include: - Cutting calories. The key to weight loss is reducing how many calories you take in. You and your health care providers can review your typical eating and drinking habits to see how many calories you normally consume and where you can cut back. You and your doctor can decide how many calories you need to take in each day to lose weight, but a typical amount is 1,200 to 1,500 calories for women and 1,500 to 1,800 for men. - Feeling full on less. The concept of energy density can help you satisfy your hunger with fewer calories. All foods have a certain number of calories within a given amount (volume). Some foods - such as desserts, candies, fats and processed foods - are high in energy density. This means that a small volume of that food has a large number of calories. In contrast, other foods, such as fruits and vegetables, have lower energy density. These foods provide a larger portion size with a fewer number of calories. By eating larger portions of foods that have fewer calories, you reduce hunger pangs, take in fewer calories and feel better about your meal, which contributes to how satisfied you feel overall. - Making healthier choices. To make your overall diet healthier, eat more plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables and whole-grain carbohydrates. Also emphasize lean sources of protein - such as beans, lentils and soy - and lean meats. If you like fish, try to include fish twice a week. Limit salt and added sugar. Stick with low-fat dairy products. Eat small amounts of fats, and make sure they come from heart-healthy sources, such as olive, canola and nut oils. - Restricting certain foods. Certain diets limit the amount of a particular food group, such as high-carbohydrate or full-fat foods. Ask your doctor which diet plans have been found effective and which might be helpful for you. Drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is a sure way to consume more calories than you intended, and limiting these drinks or eliminating them altogether is a good place to start cutting calories. - Meal replacements. These plans suggest that you replace one or two meals with their products - such as low-calorie shakes or meal bars - and eat healthy snacks and a healthy, balanced third meal that&apos;s low in fat and calories. In the short term, this type of diet can help you lose weight. Keep in mind that these diets likely won&apos;t teach you how to change your overall lifestyle, though, so you may have to keep this up if you want to keep your weight off. Be wary of quick fixes. You may be tempted by fad diets that promise fast and easy weight loss. The reality, however, is that there are no magic foods or quick fixes. Fad diets may help in the short term, but the long-term results don&apos;t appear to be any better than other diets. Similarly, you may lose weight on a crash diet, but you&apos;re likely to regain it when you stop the diet. To lose weight - and keep it off - you have to adopt healthy-eating habits that you can maintain over time. Exercise and activity Increased physical activity or exercise is an essential part of obesity treatment. Most people who are able to maintain their weight loss for more than a year get regular exercise, even simply walking. To boost your activity level: - Exercise. People who are overweight or obese need to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity to prevent further weight gain or to maintain the loss of a modest amount of weight. To achieve more-significant weight loss, you may need to exercise 300 minutes or more a week. You probably will need to gradually increase the amount you exercise as your endurance and fitness improve. - Keep moving. Even though regular aerobic exercise is the most efficient way to burn calories and shed excess weight, any extra movement helps burn calories. Making simple changes throughout your day can add up to big benefits. Park farther from store entrances, rev up your household chores, garden, get up and move around periodically, and wear a pedometer to track how many steps you actually take over the course of a day. Behavior changes A behavior modification program can help you make lifestyle changes and lose weight and keep it off. Steps to take include examining your current habits to find out what factors, stresses or situations may have contributed to your obesity. Everyone is different and has different obstacles to managing weight, such as a lack of time to exercise or late-night eating. Tailor your behavior changes to address your individual concerns. Behavior modification, sometimes called behavior therapy, can include: - Counseling. Therapy or interventions with trained mental health or other professionals can help you address emotional and behavioral issues related to eating. Therapy can help you understand why you overeat and learn healthy ways to cope with anxiety. You can also learn how to monitor your diet and activity, understand eating triggers, and cope with food cravings. Therapy can take place on both an individual and group basis. More-intensive programs - those that include 12 to 26 sessions a year - may be more helpful in achieving your weight-loss goals. - Support groups. You can find camaraderie and understanding in support groups where others share similar challenges with obesity. Check with your doctor, local hospitals or commercial weight-loss programs for support groups in your area, such as Weight Watchers. Prescription weight-loss medication Losing weight requires a healthy diet and regular exercise. But in certain situations, prescription weight-loss medication may help. Keep in mind, though, that weight-loss medication is meant to be used along with diet, exercise and behavior changes, not instead of them. If you don&apos;t make these other changes in your life, medication is unlikely to work. Your doctor may recommend weight-loss medication if other methods of weight loss haven&apos;t worked for you and you meet one of the following criteria: - Your body mass index (BMI) is 30 or greater - Your BMI is greater than 27, and you also have medical complications of obesity, such as diabetes, high blood pressure or sleep apnea Before selecting a medication for you, your doctor will consider your health history, as well as possible side effects. Some weight-loss medications can&apos;t be used by women who are pregnant, or people who take certain medications or have chronic health conditions. Commonly prescribed weight-loss medications include orlistat (Xenical), lorcaserin (Belviq), phentermine and topiramate (Qsymia), buproprion and naltrexone (Contrave), and liraglutide (Saxenda). You will need close medical monitoring while taking a prescription weight-loss medication. Also, keep in mind that a weight-loss medication may not work for everyone, and the effects may wane over time. When you stop taking a weight-loss medication, you may regain much or all of the weight you lost. Weight-loss surgery In some cases, weight-loss surgery, also called bariatric surgery, is an option. Weight-loss surgery limits the amount of food you&apos;re able to comfortably eat or decreases the absorption of food and calories or both. While weight-loss surgery offers the best chance of losing the most weight, it can pose serious risks. Weight-loss surgery for obesity may be considered if you have tried other methods to lose weight that haven&apos;t worked and: - You have extreme obesity (BMI of 40 or higher) - Your BMI is 35 to 39.9, and you also have a serious weight-related health problem, such as diabetes or high blood pressure - You&apos;re committed to making the lifestyle changes that are necessary for surgery to work It doesn&apos;t guarantee that you&apos;ll lose all of your excess weight or that you&apos;ll keep it off long term. Weight-loss success after surgery depends on your commitment to making lifelong changes in your eating and exercise habits. It doesn&apos;t guarantee that you&apos;ll lose all of your excess weight or that you&apos;ll keep it off long term. Weight-loss success after surgery depends on your commitment to making lifelong changes in your eating and exercise habits. Common weight-loss surgeries include: - Gastric bypass surgery. In gastric bypass (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), the surgeon creates a small pouch at the top of your stomach. The small intestine is then cut a short distance below the main stomach and connected to the new pouch. Food and liquid flow directly from the pouch into this part of the intestine, bypassing most of your stomach. - Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). In this procedure, your stomach is separated into two pouches with an inflatable band. Pulling the band tight, like a belt, the surgeon creates a tiny channel between the two pouches. The band keeps the opening from expanding and is generally designed to stay in place permanently. - Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. This procedure begins with the surgeon removing a large part of the stomach. The surgeon leaves the valve that releases food to the small intestine and the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). Then the surgeon closes off the middle section of the intestine and attaches the last part directly to the duodenum. The separated section of the intestine is reattached to the end of the intestine to allow bile and digestive juices to flow into this part of the intestine. - Gastric sleeve. In this procedure, part of the stomach is removed, creating a smaller reservoir for food. It&apos;s a less complicated surgery than gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. Other treatments Vagal nerve blockade is another treatment for obesity. It involves implanting a device under the skin of the abdomen that sends intermittent electrical pulses to the abdominal vagus nerve, which tells the brain when the stomach feels empty or full. This new technology received FDA approval in 2014 for use by adults who have not been able to lose weight with a weight-loss program and who have a BMI of 35 to 45 with at least one obesity-related condition, such as type 2 diabetes. Preventing weight regain after obesity treatment Unfortunately, it&apos;s common to regain weight no matter what obesity treatment methods you try. If you take weight-loss medications, you&apos;ll probably regain weight when you stop taking them. You might even regain weight after weight-loss surgery if you continue to overeat or overindulge in high-calorie foods. But that doesn&apos;t mean your weight-loss efforts are futile. One of the best ways to prevent regaining the weight you&apos;ve lost is to get regular physical activity. Aim for 60 minutes a day. Keep track of your physical activity if it helps you stay motivated and on course. As you lose weight and gain better health, talk to your doctor about what additional activities you might be able to do and, if appropriate, how to give your activity and exercise a boost. You may always have to remain vigilant about your weight. Combining a healthier diet and more activity in a practical and sustainable manner are the best ways to keep the weight you lost off for the long term. Take your weight loss and weight maintenance one day at a time and surround yourself with supportive resources to help ensure your success. Find a healthier way of living that you can stick with for the long term.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (Treatment): Treatments for obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) include breathing support, weight loss, and medicines. The goals of treating OHS may include: Supporting and aiding your breathing Achieving major weight loss Treating underlying and related conditions Breathing Support Positive Airway Pressure Treatment for OHS often involves a machine that provides positive airway pressure (PAP) while you sleep. PAP therapy uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open. This treatment can help your body better maintain the carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in your blood. PAP therapy also can help relieve daytime sleepiness. Your doctor might recommend CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) or BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure). CPAP provides continuous mild air pressure to keep your airways open. BiPAP works almost the same, but it changes the air pressure while you breathe in and out. The machines have three main parts: A mask or other device that fits over your nose or your nose and mouth. Straps keep the mask in place while you&apos;re wearing it. A tube that connects the mask to the machine&apos;s motor. A motor that blows air into the tube. Some machines have other features, such as heated humidifiers. The machines are small, lightweight, and fairly quiet. The noise they make is soft and rhythmic. Some people who have OHS receive extra oxygen as part of their PAP treatment. However, oxygen therapy alone isn&apos;t recommended as a treatment for OHS. PAP therapy also is used to treat obstructive sleep apnea. Many people who have OHS also have this common condition. If your doctor prescribes PAP therapy, you&apos;ll work with someone from a home equipment provider to select a CPAP or BiPAP machine. The home equipment provider will help you pick a machine based on your prescription and the features that meet your needs. Ventilator Support If you have severe OHS that requires treatment in a hospital, you might be put on a ventilator. A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing. This machine: Gets oxygen into your lungs Removes carbon dioxide from your body Helps you breathe easier A ventilator blows air, or air with extra oxygen, into the airways through a breathing tube. One end of the tube is inserted into your windpipe, and the other end is hooked to the ventilator. Usually, the breathing tube is put into your nose or mouth and then moved down into your throat. A tube placed like this is called an endotracheal (en-do-TRA-ke-al) tube. Endotracheal tubes are used only in a hospital setting. Sometimes the breathing tube is placed through a surgically made hole called a tracheostomy (TRA-ke-OS-toe-me). The hole goes through the front of your neck and into your windpipe. The procedure to make a tracheostomy usually is done in an operating room. You&apos;ll be given medicine so you won&apos;t feel any pain. The tracheostomy allows you to be on a ventilator in the hospital, in a long-term care facility, or at home. Talk with your doctor about how long you&apos;ll need ventilator support and whether you can receive treatment at home. For more information about ventilator support, go to the Health Topics  Ventilator/Ventilator Support article. Weight Loss Your doctor will likely recommend weight loss as part of your treatment plan. Successful weight loss often involves setting goals and making lifestyle changes. For example, eating fewer calories and being physically active can help you lose weight. Medicines and weight-loss surgery might be an option if lifestyle changes aren&apos;t enough. Your doctor will advise you on the best weight-loss treatment for you. For more information about weight loss, go to the treatment section of the Health Topics Overweight and Obesity article. Medicines Your doctor may prescribe medicines to treat OHS (although this treatment is less common than others). Your doctor also may advise you to avoid certain substances and medicines that can worsen OHS. Examples include alcohol, sedatives, and narcotics. They can interfere with how well your body is able to maintain normal carbon dioxide and oxygen levels. If you&apos;re having surgery, make sure you tell your surgeon and health care team that you have OHS. Some medicines routinely used for surgery can worsen your condition.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Childhood obesity (Treatment): Treatment for childhood obesity is based on your child&apos;s age and if he or she has other medical conditions. Treatment usually includes changes in your child&apos;s eating habits and physical activity level. In certain circumstances, treatment might include medications or weight-loss surgery. Treatment for children who are overweight The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children older than 2 and adolescents whose weight falls in the overweight category be put on a weight-maintenance program to slow the progress of weight gain. This strategy allows the child to add inches in height but not pounds, causing BMI to drop over time into a healthier range. Treatment for children who are obese Children ages 6 to 11 who are obese might be encouraged to modify their eating habits for gradual weight loss of no more than 1 pound (or about 0.5 kilogram) a month. Older children and adolescents who are obese or severely obese might be encouraged to modify their eating habits to aim for weight loss of up to 2 pounds (or about 1 kilogram) a week. The methods for maintaining your child&apos;s current weight or losing weight are the same: Your child needs to eat a healthy diet - both in terms of type and amount of food - and increase physical activity. Success depends largely on your commitment to helping your child make these changes. Healthy eating Parents are the ones who buy groceries, cook meals and decide where the food is eaten. Even small changes can make a big difference in your child&apos;s health. - When food shopping, choose fruits and vegetables. Cut back on convenience foods - such as cookies, crackers and prepared meals - which are often high in sugar, fat and calories. Always have healthy snacks available. - Limit sweetened beverages. This includes those that contain fruit juice. These drinks provide little nutritional value in exchange for their high calories. They also can make your child feel too full to eat healthier foods. - Limit fast food. Many of the menu options are high in fat and calories. - Sit down together for family meals. Make it an event - a time to share news and tell stories. Discourage eating in front of a TV, computer or video game screen, which can lead to fast eating and lowered awareness of amount eaten. - Serve appropriate portion sizes. Children don&apos;t need as much food as adults do. Allow your child to eat until he or she is full, even if that means leaving food on the plate. And remember, when you eat out, restaurant portion sizes are often significantly oversized. Physical activity A critical part of achieving and maintaining a healthy weight, especially for children, is physical activity. It burns calories, strengthens bones and muscles, and helps children sleep well at night and stay alert during the day. Good habits established in childhood help adolescents maintain healthy weights despite the hormonal changes, rapid growth and social influences that often lead to overeating. And active children are more likely to become fit adults. To increase your child&apos;s activity level: - Limit TV and recreational computer time. Time spent watching television or using computers, smartphones or tablets is known as screen time. Children younger than 18 months should avoid all screen time, except for video-chatting with family and friends. For older preschooolers, limit screen use to 1 hour per day of high-quality programming. - Emphasize activity, not exercise. Children should be moderately to vigorously active for at least an hour a day. Your child&apos;s activity doesn&apos;t have to be a structured exercise program - the object is to get him or her moving. Free-play activities - such as playing hide-and-seek, tag or jump-rope - can be great for burning calories and improving fitness. - Find activities your child likes. For instance, if your child is artistically inclined, go on a nature hike to collect leaves and rocks that your child can use to make a collage. If your child likes to climb, head for the nearest neighborhood jungle gym or climbing wall. If your child likes to read, then walk or bike to the neighborhood library for a book. Medications Medication might be prescribed for some adolescents as part of an overall weight-loss plan. The risks of taking a prescription medication over the long term are unknown, and the medication&apos;s effect on weight loss and weight maintenance for adolescents is still in question. Weight-loss surgery Weight-loss surgery may be an option for severely obese adolescents who have been unable to lose weight through lifestyle changes. However, as with any type of surgery, there are potential risks and long-term complications. Also, the long-term effects of weight-loss surgery on future growth and development are largely unknown. Weight-loss surgery in adolescents is uncommon. But your doctor might recommend this surgery if your child&apos;s weight poses a greater health threat than do the potential risks of surgery. It&apos;s important that a child being considered for weight-loss surgery meet with a team of pediatric specialists, including a pediatric endocrinologist, psychologist and dietitian. Weight-loss surgery isn&apos;t a miracle cure. It doesn&apos;t guarantee that an adolescent will lose all of his or her excess weight or be able to keep it off long term. And surgery doesn&apos;t replace the need for a healthy diet and regular physical activity.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Deciding about treatments that prolong life: Sometimes after injury or a long illness, the main organs of the body no longer work properly without support. Your health care provider may tell you that these organs will not repair themselves. Medical care to prolong life can keep you alive when these organs stop working well. The treatments extend your life, but DO NOT cure your illness. These are called life-sustaining treatments. Treatments to extend life can include the use of machines. This equipment does the work of the body organ, such as: - A machine to help with breathing (ventilator) - A machine to help your kidneys (dialysis) - A tube into your stomach to provide food (nasogastric or gastrostomy tube) - A tube into your vein to provide fluids and medicines (intravenous, IV tube) - A tube or mask to supply oxygen If you are near the end of your life or you have an illness that will not improve, you can choose what kind of treatment you want to receive. You should know that the illness or the injury is the main cause of the end of life, not the removal of life support equipment. To help with your decision: - Talk to your providers to learn about life support care you are receiving or may need in the future. - Learn about the treatments and how they would benefit you. - Learn about side effects or problems the treatments might cause. - Think about the quality of life you value. - Ask your provider what happens if life support care is stopped or you choose not to start a treatment. - Find out if you will have more pain or discomfort if you stop life support care.

				<AnswerText>Overweight and Obesity (Diagnosis): Your doctor may diagnose overweight and obesity based on your medical history, physical exams that confirm you have a high body mass index (BMI) and possibly a high waist circumference, and tests to rule out other medical conditions. Confirming a high body mass index (BMI) To diagnose overweight and obesity, doctors measure BMI using calculations that depend on whether you are a child or an adult. Children: A healthy weight is usually when your child’s BMI is at the 5th percentile up to less than the 85th percentile based on growth charts for children who are the same age and sex. To figure out your child’s BMI, use the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) BMI Percentile Calculator for Child and Teen and compare the BMI with the table below. Adults: A healthy weight for adults is usually when your BMI is 18.5 to less than 25. To figure out your BMI, use the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s online BMI calculator and compare it with the table below. You can also download the BMI calculator app for iPhone and Android. Even if your BMI is in the healthy range, it is possible to be diagnosed as obese if you have a large waist circumference that suggests increased amounts of fat in your abdomen that can lead to complications. Medical history Your doctor will ask about your eating and physical activity habits, family history, and will see if you have other risk factors Your doctor may ask if you have any other signs or symptoms. This information can help determine if you have other conditions that may be causing you to be overweight or obese or if you have complications from being overweight or obese. Physical exam During your physical exam, your doctor will measure your weight and height to calculate your BMI. Your doctor may also measure your waist circumference to estimate the amount of unhealthy fat in your abdomen. In adults, a waist circumference over 35 inches for women who are not pregnant or 40 inches for men can help diagnose obesity and assess risk of future complications. If you are of South Asian or Central and South American descent, your doctor may use smaller waist circumference values to diagnose your obesity. People from these backgrounds often don’t show signs of a large waist circumference even though they may have unhealthy amounts of fat deep in their abdomens and may be diagnosed with obesity. Visit Assessing Your Weight for more information. Read Living With for more information about why it is important to monitor your waist circumference to assess your risk for complications. Tests to identify other medical conditions Your doctor may order some of the following tests to identify medical conditions that may be causing your overweight and obesity. Blood tests. Blood tests that check your thyroid hormone levels can help rule out hypothyroidism as a cause of your overweight or obesity. Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) tests can rule out Cushing’s syndrome. Total testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) tests can help rule out polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Pelvic ultrasound to examine the ovaries and detect cysts. This can rule out PCOS. Reminders Return to Risk Factors to review family history, lifestyle, or other environmental factors that increase your risk of developing overweight and obesity.

				<AnswerText>How to diagnose Obesity?: The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history, eating habits, and exercise routine. The two most common ways to assess your weight and measure health risks related to your weight are: - Body mass index (BMI) - Waist circumference (your waist measurement in inches) BMI is calculated using height and weight. You and your provider can use your BMI to estimate how much body fat you have. Your waist measurement is another way to estimate how much body fat you have. Extra weight around your middle or stomach area increases your risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. People with &quot;apple-shaped&quot; bodies (meaning they tend to store fat around their waist and have a slim lower body) also have an increased risk for these diseases. Skin fold measurements may be taken to check your body fat percentage. Blood tests may be done to look for thyroid or hormone problems that could lead to weight gain.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Childhood obesity (Diagnosis): As part of regular well-child care, the doctor calculates your child&apos;s BMI and determines where it falls on the BMI-for-age growth chart. The BMI helps indicate if your child is overweight for his or her age and height. Using the growth chart, your doctor determines your child&apos;s percentile, meaning how your child compares with other children of the same sex and age. For example, if your child is in the 80th percentile, it means that compared with other children of the same sex and age, 80 percent have a lower weight or BMI. Cutoff points on these growth charts, established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, help identify children who are overweight and obese: - BMI between 85th and 94th percentiles - overweight - BMI 95th percentile or above - obesity Because BMI doesn&apos;t consider things such as being muscular or having a larger than average body frame and because growth patterns vary greatly among children, your doctor also factors in your child&apos;s growth and development. This helps determine whether your child&apos;s weight is a health concern. In addition to BMI and charting weight on the growth charts, the doctor evaluates: - Your family&apos;s history of obesity and weight-related health problems, such as diabetes - Your child&apos;s eating habits - Your child&apos;s activity level - Other health conditions your child may have - Psychosocial history, including incidences of depression and sleep disturbances and sadness and whether your child has friends or is the target of bullying Blood tests Your child&apos;s doctor might order blood tests if he or she finds that your child is obese. These tests might include: - A cholesterol test - A blood sugar test - Other blood tests to check for hormone imbalances, vitamin D deficiency or other conditions associated with obesity Some of these tests require that your child not eat or drink anything before the test. Ask if your child needs to fast before a blood test and for how long.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Obesity (Diagnosis): If your BMI is in the obese range, your health care provider will typically review your health history in detail, perform a physical exam and recommend some tests. These exams and tests generally include: - Taking your health history. Your doctor may review your weight history, weight-loss efforts, exercise habits, eating patterns, what other conditions you&apos;ve had, medications, stress levels and other issues about your health. Your doctor may also review your family&apos;s health history to see if you may be predisposed to certain conditions. - A general physical exam. This includes also measuring your height; checking vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure and temperature; listening to your heart and lungs; and examining your abdomen. - Calculating your BMI. Your doctor will check your body mass index (BMI) to determine your level of obesity. This should be done at least once a year. Your BMI also helps determine your overall health risk and what treatment may be appropriate. - Measuring your waist circumference. Fat stored around your waist, sometimes called visceral fat or abdominal fat, may further increase your risk of diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease. Women with a waist measurement (circumference) of more than 35 inches (80 centimeters, or cm) and men with a waist measurement of more than 40 inches (102 cm) may have more health risks than do people with smaller waist measurements. Like the BMI measurement, your waist circumference should be checked at least once a year. - Checking for other health problems. If you have known health problems, your doctor will evaluate them. Your doctor will also check for other possible health problems, such as high blood pressure and diabetes. - Blood tests. What tests you have depend on your health, risk factors and any current symptoms you may be having. Tests may include a cholesterol test, liver function tests, a fasting glucose, a thyroid test and others. Your doctor may also recommend certain heart tests, such as an electrocardiogram. Gathering all this information helps you and your doctor determine how much weight you need to lose and what health conditions or risks you already have. And this will guide treatment decisions.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (Diagnosis): Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is diagnosed based on your medical history, signs and symptoms, and test results. Specialists Involved A critical care specialist, pulmonologist (lung specialist), and/or sleep specialist may diagnose and treat your condition. A sleep specialist is a doctor who diagnoses and treats sleep problems. Examples of such doctors include lung and nerve specialists and ear, nose, and throat specialists. Other types of doctors also can be sleep specialists. Your health care team also may include: A registered dietitian or nutritionist to help you plan and follow a healthy diet. (Your primary care doctor also might oversee weight-loss treatment and progress.) An exercise physiologist or trainer to assess your fitness level and help create a physical activity plan that&apos;s safe for you. A bariatric surgeon if weight-loss surgery is an option for you. Medical History and Physical Exam Your doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms, such as loud snoring or daytime sleepiness. He or she also may ask about your use of alcohol and certain medicines, such as sedatives and narcotics. These substances can worsen OHS. During the physical exam, your doctor will listen to your heart with a stethoscope. He or she also will check to see whether another disease or condition could be the cause of your poor breathing. Diagnostic Tests In OHS, poor breathing leads to too much carbon dioxide and too little oxygen in the blood. An arterial blood gas test can measure the levels of these gases in your blood. For this test, a blood sample is taken from an artery, usually in your wrist. The sample is then sent to a laboratory, where the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels are measured. Other tests also can measure the carbon dioxide level or oxygen level in your blood. These tests include a serum bicarbonate test and pulse oximetry. A serum bicarbonate test measures the amount of carbon dioxide in the liquid part of your blood, called the serum. For this test, a blood sample is taken from a vein, usually in your wrist or hand. Pulse oximetry measures the level of oxygen in your blood. For this test, a small sensor is attached to your finger or ear. The sensor uses light to estimate how much oxygen is in your blood. Other Tests Your doctor may recommend other tests to help check for conditions and problems related to OHS. Polysomnogram A polysomnogram (PSG) is a type of sleep study. You usually have to stay overnight at a sleep center for a PSG. The test records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, and blood pressure. A PSG also records the amount of oxygen in your blood, how much air is moving through your nose while you breathe, snoring, and chest movements. The chest movements show whether you&apos;re making an effort to breathe. Your doctor might use the PSG results to help diagnose sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea. Lung Function Tests Lung function tests, also called pulmonary function tests, measure how well your lungs work. For example, these tests show: How much air you can take into your lungs. This amount is compared with that of other people your age, height, and sex. This allows your doctor to see whether you&apos;re in the normal range. How much air you can blow out of your lungs and how fast you can do it. How well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. The strength of your breathing muscles. Chest X Ray A chest x ray is a test that creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test can help rule out other conditions that might be causing your signs and symptoms. EKG (Electrocardiogram) An EKG is a test that detects and records the heart&apos;s electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart. The results from an EKG might show whether OHS has affected your heart function. Other Tests A complete blood count (CBC) can show whether your body is making too many red blood cells as a result of OHS. A CBC measures many parts of your blood, including red blood cells. A toxicology screen is a group of tests that shows which medicines and drugs you&apos;ve taken and how much of them you&apos;ve taken. A blood or urine sample usually is collected for a toxicology screen.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Obesity (Overview): Obesity is a complex disorder involving an excessive amount of body fat. Obesity isn&apos;t just a cosmetic concern. It increases your risk of diseases and health problems, such as heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure. Being extremely obese means you are especially likely to have health problems related to your weight. The good news is that even modest weight loss can improve or prevent the health problems associated with obesity. Dietary changes, increased physical activity and behavior changes can help you lose weight. Prescription medications and weight-loss surgery are additional options for treating obesity.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Obesity (Summary): Summary Obesity means having too much body fat. It is different from being overweight, which means weighing too much. The weight may come from muscle, bone, fat, and/or body water. Both terms mean that a person&apos;s weight is greater than what&apos;s considered healthy for his or her height. Obesity happens over time when you eat more calories than you use. The balance between calories-in and calories-out differs for each person. Factors that might affect your weight include your genetic makeup, overeating, eating high-fat foods, and not being physically active. Obesity increases your risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, and some cancers. If you have obesity, losing even 5 to 10 percent of your weight can delay or prevent some of these diseases. For example, that means losing 10 to 20 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds.

				<AnswerText>Alcohol use disorder: Alcohol use disorder (which includes a level that&apos;s sometimes called alcoholism) is a pattern of alcohol use that involves problems controlling your drinking, being preoccupied with alcohol, continuing to use alcohol even when it causes problems, having to drink more to get the same effect, or having withdrawal symptoms when you rapidly decrease or stop drinking. Unhealthy alcohol use includes any alcohol use that puts your health or safety at risk or causes other alcohol-related problems. It also includes binge drinking - a pattern of drinking where a male consumes five or more drinks within two hours or a female downs at least four drinks within two hours. Binge drinking causes significant health and safety risks. If your pattern of drinking results in repeated significant distress and problems functioning in your daily life, you likely have alcohol use disorder. It can range from mild to severe. However, even a mild disorder can escalate and lead to serious problems, so early treatment is important. Alcohol use disorder can be mild, moderate or severe, based on the number of symptoms you experience. Signs and symptoms may include: - Being unable to limit the amount of alcohol you drink - Wanting to cut down on how much you drink or making unsuccessful attempts to do so - Spending a lot of time drinking, getting alcohol or recovering from alcohol use - Feeling a strong craving or urge to drink alcohol - Failing to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home due to repeated alcohol use - Continuing to drink alcohol even though you know it&apos;s causing physical, social or interpersonal problems - Giving up or reducing social and work activities and hobbies - Using alcohol in situations where it&apos;s not safe, such as when driving or swimming - Developing a tolerance to alcohol so you need more to feel its effect or you have a reduced effect from the same amount - Experiencing withdrawal symptoms - such as nausea, sweating and shaking - when you don&apos;t drink, or drinking to avoid these symptoms Alcohol use disorder can include periods of alcohol intoxication and symptoms of withdrawal. - Alcohol intoxication results as the amount of alcohol in your blood stream increases. The higher the blood alcohol concentration is, the more impaired you become. Alcohol intoxication causes behavior problems and mental changes. These may include inappropriate behavior, unstable moods, impaired judgment, slurred speech, impaired attention or memory, and poor coordination. You can also have periods called &quot;blackouts,&quot; where you don&apos;t remember events. Very high blood alcohol levels can lead to coma or even death. - Alcohol withdrawal can occur when alcohol use has been heavy and prolonged and is then stopped or greatly reduced. It can occur within several hours to four or five days later. Symptoms include sweating, rapid heartbeat, hand tremors, problems sleeping, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, restlessness and agitation, anxiety, and occasionally seizures. Symptoms can be severe enough to impair your ability to function at work or in social situations. What is considered one drink? The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one standard drink as any one of these: - 12 ounces (355 milliliters) of regular beer (about 5 percent alcohol) - 8 to 9 ounces (237 to 266 milliliters) of malt liquor (about 7 percent alcohol) - 5 ounces (148 milliliters) of unfortified wine (about 12 percent alcohol) - 1.5 ounces (44 milliliters) of 80-proof hard liquor (about 40 percent alcohol) When to see a doctor If you feel that you sometimes drink too much alcohol, or it&apos;s causing problems, or your family is concerned about your drinking, talk with your doctor. Other ways to get help include talking with a mental health provider or seeking help from a support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar type of self-help group. Because denial is common, you may not feel like you have a problem with drinking. You might not recognize how much you drink or how many problems in your life are related to alcohol use. Listen to relatives, friends or co-workers when they ask you to examine your drinking habits or to seek help. Consider talking with someone who has had a problem drinking, but has stopped. If your loved one needs help Many people with alcohol use disorder hesitate to get treatment because they don&apos;t recognize they have a problem. An intervention from loved ones can help some people recognize and accept that they need professional help. If you&apos;re concerned about someone who drinks too much, ask a professional experienced in alcohol treatment for advice on how to approach that person. Genetic, psychological, social and environmental factors can impact how drinking alcohol affects your body and behavior. Theories suggest that for certain people drinking has a different and stronger impact that can lead to alcohol use disorder. Over time, drinking too much alcohol may change the normal function of the areas of your brain associated with the experience of pleasure, judgment and the ability to exercise control over your behavior. This may result in craving alcohol to try to restore good feelings or reduce negative ones. Risk factors for alcohol use disorder include: - Steady drinking over time. Drinking too much on a regular basis for an extended period or binge drinking on a regular basis can lead to alcohol-related problems or alcohol use disorder. - Age. People who begin drinking at an early age, and especially in a binge fashion, are at a higher risk of alcohol use disorder. Alcohol use may begin in the teens, but alcohol use disorder occurs more frequently in the 20s and 30s. However, it can begin at any age. - Family history. The risk of alcohol use disorder is higher for people who have a parent or other close relative who has problems with alcohol. This may be influenced by genetic factors. - Depression and other mental health problems. It&apos;s common for people with a mental health disorder such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder to have problems with alcohol or other substances. - Social and cultural factors. Having friends or a close partner who drinks regularly could increase your risk of alcohol use disorder. The glamorous way that drinking is sometimes portrayed in the media also may send the message that it&apos;s OK to drink too much. For young people, the influence of parents, peers and other role models can impact risk. Alcohol depresses your central nervous system. In some people, the initial reaction may be stimulation. But as you continue to drink, you become sedated. Too much alcohol affects your speech, muscle coordination and vital centers of your brain. A heavy drinking binge may even cause a life-threatening coma or death. This is of particular concern when you&apos;re taking certain medications that also depress the brain&apos;s function. Impact on your safety Excessive drinking can reduce your judgment skills and lower inhibitions, leading to poor choices and dangerous situations or behaviors, including: - Motor vehicle accidents and other types of accidental injury, such as drowning - Relationship problems - Poor performance at work or school - Increased likelihood of committing violent crimes or being the victim of a crime - Legal problems or problems with employment or finances - Problems with other substance use - Engaging in risky, unprotected sex, or becoming the victim of sexual abuse or date rape - Increased risk of attempted or completed suicide Impact on your health Drinking too much alcohol on a single occasion or over time can cause health problems, including: - Liver disease. Heavy drinking can cause increased fat in the liver (hepatic steatosis), inflammation of the liver (alcoholic hepatitis), and over time, irreversible destruction and scarring of liver tissue (cirrhosis). - Digestive problems. Heavy drinking can result in inflammation of the stomach lining (gastritis), as well as stomach and esophageal ulcers. It also can interfere with absorption of B vitamins and other nutrients. Heavy drinking can damage your pancreas or lead to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). - Heart problems. Excessive drinking can lead to high blood pressure and increases your risk of an enlarged heart, heart failure or stroke. Even a single binge can cause a serious heart arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation. - Diabetes complications. Alcohol interferes with the release of glucose from your liver and can increase the risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). This is dangerous if you have diabetes and are already taking insulin to lower your blood sugar level. - Sexual function and menstruation issues. Excessive drinking can cause erectile dysfunction in men. In women, it can interrupt menstruation. - Eye problems. Over time, heavy drinking can cause involuntary rapid eye movement (nystagmus) as well as weakness and paralysis of your eye muscles due to a deficiency of vitamin B-1 (thiamine). A thiamine deficiency also can be associated with other brain changes, such as irreversible dementia, if not promptly treated. - Birth defects. Alcohol use during pregnancy may cause miscarriage. It also may cause fetal alcohol syndrome, resulting in giving birth to a child who has physical and developmental problems that last a lifetime. - Bone damage. Alcohol may interfere with the production of new bone. This bone loss can lead to thinning bones (osteoporosis) and an increased risk of fractures. Alcohol can also damage bone marrow, which makes blood cells. This can cause a low platelet count, which may result in bruising and bleeding. - Neurological complications. Excessive drinking can affect your nervous system, causing numbness and pain in your hands and feet, disordered thinking, dementia, and short-term memory loss. - Weakened immune system. Excessive alcohol use can make it harder for your body to resist disease, increasing your risk of various illnesses, especially pneumonia. - Increased risk of cancer. Long-term excessive alcohol use has been linked to a higher risk of many cancers, including mouth, throat, liver, colon and breast cancer. Even moderate drinking can increase the risk of breast cancer. - Medication and alcohol interactions. Some medications interact with alcohol, increasing its toxic effects. Drinking while taking these medications can either increase or decrease their effectiveness, or make them dangerous. You&apos;re likely to start by seeing your primary care doctor. If your doctor suspects you have a problem with alcohol, he or she may refer you to a mental health provider. To assess your problem with alcohol, your health care provider will likely: - Ask you several questions related to your drinking habits. The health care provider may ask for permission to speak with family members or friends. However, confidentiality laws prevent your health care provider from giving out any information about you without your consent. - Perform a physical exam. Your health care provider may do a physical exam and ask questions about your health. There are many physical signs that indicate complications of alcohol use. - Lab tests and imaging tests. While there are no specific tests to diagnose alcohol use disorder, certain patterns of lab test abnormalities may strongly suggest it. And you may need tests to identify health problems that may be linked to your alcohol use. Damage to your organs may be seen on tests. - Complete a psychological evaluation. This evaluation includes questions about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may need to fill out a questionnaire to help answer these questions. - Use the DSM-5 criteria. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, is often used by mental health providers to diagnose mental health conditions and by insurance companies to reimburse for treatment. Treatment for alcohol use disorder can vary, depending on your needs. Treatment may involve a brief intervention, individual or group counseling, an outpatient program, or a residential inpatient stay. Working to stop the use of alcohol to improve quality of life is the main treatment goal. Treatment for alcohol use disorder may include: - Detox and withdrawal. Treatment may begin with a program of detoxification or detox - withdrawal that&apos;s medically managed - which generally takes two to seven days. You may need to take sedating medications to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Detox is usually done at an inpatient treatment center or a hospital. - Learning skills and establishing a treatment plan. This usually involves alcohol treatment specialists. It may include goal setting, behavior change techniques, use of self-help manuals, counseling and follow-up care at a treatment center. - Psychological counseling. Counseling and therapy for groups and individuals help you better understand your problem with alcohol and support recovery from the psychological aspects of alcohol use. You may benefit from couples or family therapy - family support can be an important part of the recovery process. - Oral medications. Naltrexone (Revia), a drug that blocks the good feelings alcohol causes, may prevent heavy drinking and reduce the urge to drink. Acamprosate (Campral) may help combat alcohol cravings once you stop drinking. Disulfiram (Antabuse) may help to prevent you from drinking, though it won&apos;t cure alcohol use disorder or remove the compulsion to drink. If you drink alcohol, the drug produces a physical reaction that may include flushing, nausea, vomiting and headaches. Unlike disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate don&apos;t make you feel sick after taking a drink. - Injected medication. Vivitrol, a version of the drug naltrexone, is injected once a month by a health care professional. Although similar medication can be taken in pill form, the injectable version of the drug may be easier for people recovering from alcohol use disorder to use consistently. - Continuing support. Aftercare programs and support groups help people recovering from alcohol use disorder to stop drinking, manage relapses and cope with necessary lifestyle changes. This may include medical or psychological care or attending a support group. - Treatment for psychological problems. Alcohol use disorder commonly occurs along with other mental health disorders. If you have depression, anxiety or another mental health condition, you may need talk therapy (psychotherapy), medications or other treatment. - Medical treatment for health conditions. Many alcohol-related health problems improve significantly once you stop drinking. But some health conditions may warrant continued treatment and follow-up. - Spiritual practice. People who are involved with some type of regular spiritual practice may find it easier to maintain recovery from alcohol use disorder or other addictions. For many people, gaining greater insight into their spiritual side is a key element in recovery. Residential treatment programs For a serious alcohol problem, you may need a stay at a residential treatment facility. Most residential treatment programs include individual and group therapy, support groups, educational lectures, family involvement and activity therapy. Residential treatment programs typically include licensed alcohol and drug counselors, social workers, nurses, doctors and others with expertise and experience in treating alcohol use disorder. You&apos;ll need to focus on changing your habits and making different lifestyle choices. - Consider your social situation. Make it clear to your friends and family that you&apos;re not drinking alcohol. Develop a support system of friends and family who can support your recovery. You may need to distance yourself from friends and social situations that impair your recovery. - Develop healthy habits. For example, good sleep, regular physical activity, managing stress more effectively and eating well all can make it easier for you to recover from alcohol use disorder. - Do things that don&apos;t involve alcohol. You may find that many of your activities involve drinking. Replace them with hobbies or activities that are not centered around alcohol. Avoid replacing conventional medical treatment or psychotherapy with alternative medicine. But if used in addition to your treatment plan when recovering from alcohol use disorder, these techniques may be helpful: - Yoga. Yoga&apos;s series of postures and controlled breathing exercises may help you relax and manage stress. - Meditation. During meditation, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress. - Acupuncture. With acupuncture, hair-thin needles are inserted under the skin. Acupuncture may help reduce anxiety and depression.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Alcohol use disorder: Alcohol use disorder is when your drinking causes serious problems in your life, yet you keep drinking. You may also need more and more alcohol to feel drunk. Stopping suddenly may cause withdrawal symptoms. No one knows what causes problems with alcohol. Health experts think that it may be a combination of a person&apos;s: - Genes - Environment - Psychology, such as being impulsive or having low self-esteem Drinking an excessive amount of alcohol can put you at risk for alcohol-related problems if: - You are a man who has 15 or more drinks a week, or often have 5 or more drinks at a time - You are a woman who has 8 or more drinks a week, or often have 4 or more drinks at a time One drink is defined as 12 ounces or 360 milliliters (mL) of beer (5% alcohol content), 5 ounces or 150 mL of wine (12% alcohol content), or a 1.5-ounce or 45-mL shot of liquor (80-proof, or 40% alcohol content). If you have a parent with alcohol use disorder, you are more at risk for alcohol problems. You also may be more likely to have problems with alcohol if you: - Are a young adult under peer pressure - Have depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, or schizophrenia - Can easily obtain alcohol - Have low self-esteem - Have problems with relationships - Live a stressful lifestyle If you are concerned about your drinking, it may help to take a careful look at your alcohol use. Doctors have developed a list of symptoms that a person has to have in the past year to be diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. Symptoms may include: - Times when you drink more or longer than you planned to - Wanted to, or tried to, cut down or stop drinking, but could not - Spend a lot of time and effort to get alcohol, use it, or recover from its effects - Crave alcohol or have a strong urge to use it - Alcohol use is causing you to miss work or school, or you do not perform as well because of drinking - Continue to drink, even when relationships with family and friends are being harmed - Stop taking part in activities that you used to enjoy - While or after drinking, you get into situations that can cause you to get hurt, such as driving, using machinery, or having unsafe sex - Keep drinking, even though you know it is making a health problem caused by alcohol worse - Need more and more alcohol to feel its effects or to get drunk - You get withdrawal symptoms when the effects of alcohol wear off Your health care provider will: - Examine you - Ask about your medical and family history - Ask about your alcohol use, and if you have any of the symptoms listed above Your provider may order tests to check for health problems that are common in people who use alcohol. These tests may include: - Blood alcohol level (this shows if you have recently been drinking alcohol. It does not diagnose alcohol use disorder.) - Complete blood count - Liver function tests - Magnesium blood test Many people with an alcohol problem need to completely stop using alcohol. This is called abstinence. Having strong social and family support can help make it easier to quit drinking. Some people are able to just cut back on their drinking. So even if you do not give up alcohol altogether, you may be able to drink less. This can improve your health and relationships with others. It can also help you perform better at work or school. However, many people who drink too much find they can&apos;t just cut back. Abstinence may be the only way to manage a drinking problem. DECIDING TO QUIT Like many people with an alcohol problem, you may not recognize that your drinking has gotten out of  hand. An important first step is to be aware of how much you drink. It also helps to understand the health risks of alcohol. If you decide to quit drinking, talk with your provider. Treatment involves helping you realize how much your alcohol use is harming your life and the lives those around you. Depending on how much and how long you have been drinking, you may be at risk for alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal can be very uncomfortable and even life threatening. If you have been drinking a lot, you should cut back or stop drinking only under the care of a doctor. Talk with your provider about how to stop using alcohol. LONG-TERM SUPPORT Alcohol recovery or support programs can help you stop drinking completely. These programs usually offer: - Education about alcohol use and its effects - Counseling and therapy to discuss how to control your thoughts and behaviors - Physical health care For the best chance of success, you should live with people who support your efforts to avoid alcohol. Some programs offer housing options for people with alcohol problems. Depending on your needs and the programs that are available: - You may be treated in a special recovery center (inpatient) - You may attend a program while you live at home (outpatient) You may be prescribed medicines to help you quit. They are often used with long-term counseling or support groups. These medicines make it less likely that you will drink again or help limit the amount you drink. Drinking may mask depression or other mood or anxiety disorders. If you have a mood disorder, it may become more noticeable when you stop drinking. Your provider will treat any mental disorders in addition to your alcohol treatment. Support groups help many people who are dealing with alcohol use. How well a person does depends on whether they can successfully cut back or stop drinking. It may take several tries to stop drinking for good. If you are struggling to quit, do not give up hope. Getting treatment, if needed, along with support and encouragement from support groups and those around you can help you remain sober. Alcohol use disorder can increase your risk of many health problems, including: - Bleeding in the digestive tract - Brain cell damage - A brain disorder called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome - Cancer of the esophagus, liver, colon, breast and other areas - Changes in the menstrual cycle - Delirium tremens (DTs) - Dementia and memory loss - Depression and suicide - Erectile dysfunction - Heart damage - High blood pressure - Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) - Liver disease, including cirrhosis - Nerve damage - Poor nutrition - Sleeping problems (insomnia) - Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) Alcohol use also increases your risk for violence. Drinking alcohol while you are pregnant can lead to severe birth defects in the baby. This is called fetal alcohol syndrome. Talk with your provider if you or someone you know may have an alcohol problem. Seek immediate medical care or call your local emergency number (such as 911) if you or someone you know has an alcohol problem and develops severe confusion, seizures, or bleeding. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recommends: - Women should not drink more than 1 drink per day - Men should not drink more than 2 drinks per day Updated by: Laura J.

				<AnswerText>Alcohol use disorder (Treatment): Treatment for alcohol use disorder can vary, depending on your needs. Treatment may involve a brief intervention, individual or group counseling, an outpatient program, or a residential inpatient stay. Working to stop the use of alcohol to improve quality of life is the main treatment goal. Treatment for alcohol use disorder may include: - Detox and withdrawal. Treatment may begin with a program of detoxification or detox - withdrawal that&apos;s medically managed - which generally takes two to seven days. You may need to take sedating medications to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Detox is usually done at an inpatient treatment center or a hospital. - Learning skills and establishing a treatment plan. This usually involves alcohol treatment specialists. It may include goal setting, behavior change techniques, use of self-help manuals, counseling and follow-up care at a treatment center. - Psychological counseling. Counseling and therapy for groups and individuals help you better understand your problem with alcohol and support recovery from the psychological aspects of alcohol use. You may benefit from couples or family therapy - family support can be an important part of the recovery process. - Oral medications. Naltrexone (Revia), a drug that blocks the good feelings alcohol causes, may prevent heavy drinking and reduce the urge to drink. Acamprosate (Campral) may help combat alcohol cravings once you stop drinking. Disulfiram (Antabuse) may help to prevent you from drinking, though it won&apos;t cure alcohol use disorder or remove the compulsion to drink. If you drink alcohol, the drug produces a physical reaction that may include flushing, nausea, vomiting and headaches. Unlike disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate don&apos;t make you feel sick after taking a drink. - Injected medication. Vivitrol, a version of the drug naltrexone, is injected once a month by a health care professional. Although similar medication can be taken in pill form, the injectable version of the drug may be easier for people recovering from alcohol use disorder to use consistently. - Continuing support. Aftercare programs and support groups help people recovering from alcohol use disorder to stop drinking, manage relapses and cope with necessary lifestyle changes. This may include medical or psychological care or attending a support group. - Treatment for psychological problems. Alcohol use disorder commonly occurs along with other mental health disorders. If you have depression, anxiety or another mental health condition, you may need talk therapy (psychotherapy), medications or other treatment. - Medical treatment for health conditions. Many alcohol-related health problems improve significantly once you stop drinking. But some health conditions may warrant continued treatment and follow-up. - Spiritual practice. People who are involved with some type of regular spiritual practice may find it easier to maintain recovery from alcohol use disorder or other addictions. For many people, gaining greater insight into their spiritual side is a key element in recovery. Residential treatment programs For a serious alcohol problem, you may need a stay at a residential treatment facility. Most residential treatment programs include individual and group therapy, support groups, educational lectures, family involvement and activity therapy. Residential treatment programs typically include licensed alcohol and drug counselors, social workers, nurses, doctors and others with expertise and experience in treating alcohol use disorder.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Alcohol use disorder (Complications): Alcohol depresses your central nervous system. In some people, the initial reaction may be stimulation. But as you continue to drink, you become sedated. Too much alcohol affects your speech, muscle coordination and vital centers of your brain. A heavy drinking binge may even cause a life-threatening coma or death. This is of particular concern when you&apos;re taking certain medications that also depress the brain&apos;s function. Impact on your safety Excessive drinking can reduce your judgment skills and lower inhibitions, leading to poor choices and dangerous situations or behaviors, including: - Motor vehicle accidents and other types of accidental injury, such as drowning - Relationship problems - Poor performance at work or school - Increased likelihood of committing violent crimes or being the victim of a crime - Legal problems or problems with employment or finances - Problems with other substance use - Engaging in risky, unprotected sex, or becoming the victim of sexual abuse or date rape - Increased risk of attempted or completed suicide Impact on your health Drinking too much alcohol on a single occasion or over time can cause health problems, including: - Liver disease. Heavy drinking can cause increased fat in the liver (hepatic steatosis), inflammation of the liver (alcoholic hepatitis), and over time, irreversible destruction and scarring of liver tissue (cirrhosis). - Digestive problems. Heavy drinking can result in inflammation of the stomach lining (gastritis), as well as stomach and esophageal ulcers. It also can interfere with absorption of B vitamins and other nutrients. Heavy drinking can damage your pancreas or lead to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). - Heart problems. Excessive drinking can lead to high blood pressure and increases your risk of an enlarged heart, heart failure or stroke. Even a single binge can cause a serious heart arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation. - Diabetes complications. Alcohol interferes with the release of glucose from your liver and can increase the risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). This is dangerous if you have diabetes and are already taking insulin to lower your blood sugar level. - Sexual function and menstruation issues. Excessive drinking can cause erectile dysfunction in men. In women, it can interrupt menstruation. - Eye problems. Over time, heavy drinking can cause involuntary rapid eye movement (nystagmus) as well as weakness and paralysis of your eye muscles due to a deficiency of vitamin B-1 (thiamine).

It also may cause fetal alcohol syndrome, resulting in giving birth to a child who has physical and developmental problems that last a lifetime. - Bone damage. Alcohol may interfere with the production of new bone. This bone loss can lead to thinning bones (osteoporosis) and an increased risk of fractures. Alcohol can also damage bone marrow, which makes blood cells. This can cause a low platelet count, which may result in bruising and bleeding. - Neurological complications. Excessive drinking can affect your nervous system, causing numbness and pain in your hands and feet, disordered thinking, dementia, and short-term memory loss. - Weakened immune system. Excessive alcohol use can make it harder for your body to resist disease, increasing your risk of various illnesses, especially pneumonia. - Increased risk of cancer.

				<AnswerText>Alcohol use disorder (Symptoms): Alcohol use disorder can be mild, moderate or severe, based on the number of symptoms you experience. Signs and symptoms may include: - Being unable to limit the amount of alcohol you drink - Wanting to cut down on how much you drink or making unsuccessful attempts to do so - Spending a lot of time drinking, getting alcohol or recovering from alcohol use - Feeling a strong craving or urge to drink alcohol - Failing to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home due to repeated alcohol use - Continuing to drink alcohol even though you know it&apos;s causing physical, social or interpersonal problems - Giving up or reducing social and work activities and hobbies - Using alcohol in situations where it&apos;s not safe, such as when driving or swimming - Developing a tolerance to alcohol so you need more to feel its effect or you have a reduced effect from the same amount - Experiencing withdrawal symptoms - such as nausea, sweating and shaking - when you don&apos;t drink, or drinking to avoid these symptoms Alcohol use disorder can include periods of alcohol intoxication and symptoms of withdrawal. - Alcohol intoxication results as the amount of alcohol in your blood stream increases. The higher the blood alcohol concentration is, the more impaired you become. Alcohol intoxication causes behavior problems and mental changes. These may include inappropriate behavior, unstable moods, impaired judgment, slurred speech, impaired attention or memory, and poor coordination. You can also have periods called &quot;blackouts,&quot; where you don&apos;t remember events. Very high blood alcohol levels can lead to coma or even death. - Alcohol withdrawal can occur when alcohol use has been heavy and prolonged and is then stopped or greatly reduced. It can occur within several hours to four or five days later. Symptoms include sweating, rapid heartbeat, hand tremors, problems sleeping, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, restlessness and agitation, anxiety, and occasionally seizures. Symptoms can be severe enough to impair your ability to function at work or in social situations. What is considered one drink? The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one standard drink as any one of these: - 12 ounces (355 milliliters) of regular beer (about 5 percent alcohol) - 8 to 9 ounces (237 to 266 milliliters) of malt liquor (about 7 percent alcohol) - 5 ounces (148 milliliters) of unfortified wine (about 12 percent alcohol) - 1.5 ounces (44 milliliters) of 80-proof hard liquor (about 40 percent alcohol) When to see a doctor If you feel that you sometimes drink too much alcohol, or it&apos;s causing problems, or your family is concerned about your drinking, talk with your doctor. Other ways to get help include talking with a mental health provider or seeking help from a support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar type of self-help group. Because denial is common, you may not feel like you have a problem with drinking. You might not recognize how much you drink or how many problems in your life are related to alcohol use. Listen to relatives, friends or co-workers when they ask you to examine your drinking habits or to seek help. Consider talking with someone who has had a problem drinking, but has stopped. If your loved one needs help Many people with alcohol use disorder hesitate to get treatment because they don&apos;t recognize they have a problem. An intervention from loved ones can help some people recognize and accept that they need professional help. If you&apos;re concerned about someone who drinks too much, ask a professional experienced in alcohol treatment for advice on how to approach that person.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What are the treatments for Alcohol use disorder?: Many people with an alcohol problem need to completely stop using alcohol. This is called abstinence. Having strong social and family support can help make it easier to quit drinking. Some people are able to just cut back on their drinking. So even if you do not give up alcohol altogether, you may be able to drink less. This can improve your health and relationships with others. It can also help you perform better at work or school. However, many people who drink too much find they cannot just cut back. Abstinence may be the only way to manage a drinking problem. DECIDING TO QUIT Like many people with an alcohol problem, you may not recognize that your drinking has gotten out of hand. An important first step is to be aware of how much you drink. It also helps to understand the health risks of alcohol. If you decide to quit drinking, talk with your health care provider. Treatment involves helping you realize how much your alcohol use is harming your life and the lives those around you. Depending on how much and how long you have been drinking, you may be at risk for alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal can be very uncomfortable and even life-threatening. If you have been drinking a lot, you should cut back or stop drinking only under the care of a doctor. Talk with your provider about how to stop using alcohol. LONG-TERM SUPPORT Alcohol recovery or support programs can help you stop drinking completely. These programs usually offer: - Education about alcohol use and its effects - Counseling and therapy to discuss how to control your thoughts and behaviors - Physical health care For the best chance of success, you should live with people who support your efforts to avoid alcohol. Some programs offer housing options for people with alcohol problems. Depending on your needs and the programs that are available: - You may be treated in a special recovery center (inpatient) - You may attend a program while you live at home (outpatient) You may be prescribed medicines to help you quit. They are often used with long-term counseling or support groups. These medicines make it less likely that you will drink again or help limit the amount you drink. Drinking may mask depression or other mood or anxiety disorders. If you have a mood disorder, it may become more noticeable when you stop drinking. Your provider will treat any mental disorders in addition to your alcohol treatment.</AnswerText>

Excessive drinking can affect your nervous system, causing numbness and pain in your hands and feet, disordered thinking, dementia, and short-term memory loss. - Weakened immune system. Excessive alcohol use can make it harder for your body to resist disease, increasing your risk of various illnesses, especially pneumonia. - Increased risk of cancer. Long-term excessive alcohol use has been linked to a higher risk of many cancers, including mouth, throat, liver, colon and breast cancer. Even moderate drinking can increase the risk of breast cancer. - Medication and alcohol interactions. Some medications interact with alcohol, increasing its toxic effects. Drinking while taking these medications can either increase or decrease their effectiveness, or make them dangerous.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Alcohol use disorder (Diagnosis): You&apos;re likely to start by seeing your primary care doctor. If your doctor suspects you have a problem with alcohol, he or she may refer you to a mental health provider. To assess your problem with alcohol, your health care provider will likely: - Ask you several questions related to your drinking habits. The health care provider may ask for permission to speak with family members or friends. However, confidentiality laws prevent your health care provider from giving out any information about you without your consent. - Perform a physical exam. Your health care provider may do a physical exam and ask questions about your health. There are many physical signs that indicate complications of alcohol use. - Lab tests and imaging tests. While there are no specific tests to diagnose alcohol use disorder, certain patterns of lab test abnormalities may strongly suggest it. And you may need tests to identify health problems that may be linked to your alcohol use. Damage to your organs may be seen on tests. - Complete a psychological evaluation. This evaluation includes questions about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may need to fill out a questionnaire to help answer these questions. - Use the DSM-5 criteria. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, is often used by mental health providers to diagnose mental health conditions and by insurance companies to reimburse for treatment.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Alcohol use disorder (Risk factors): Risk factors for alcohol use disorder include: - Steady drinking over time. Drinking too much on a regular basis for an extended period or binge drinking on a regular basis can lead to alcohol-related problems or alcohol use disorder. - Age. People who begin drinking at an early age, and especially in a binge fashion, are at a higher risk of alcohol use disorder. Alcohol use may begin in the teens, but alcohol use disorder occurs more frequently in the 20s and 30s. However, it can begin at any age. - Family history. The risk of alcohol use disorder is higher for people who have a parent or other close relative who has problems with alcohol. This may be influenced by genetic factors. - Depression and other mental health problems. It&apos;s common for people with a mental health disorder such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder to have problems with alcohol or other substances. - Social and cultural factors. Having friends or a close partner who drinks regularly could increase your risk of alcohol use disorder. The glamorous way that drinking is sometimes portrayed in the media also may send the message that it&apos;s OK to drink too much. For young people, the influence of parents, peers and other role models can impact risk.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Alcohol use disorder (Treatment): Treatment for alcohol use disorder can vary, depending on your needs. Treatment may involve a brief intervention, individual or group counseling, an outpatient program, or a residential inpatient stay. Working to stop the use of alcohol to improve quality of life is the main treatment goal. Treatment for alcohol use disorder may include: - Detox and withdrawal. Treatment may begin with a program of detoxification or detox - withdrawal that&apos;s medically managed - which generally takes two to seven days. You may need to take sedating medications to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Detox is usually done at an inpatient treatment center or a hospital. - Learning skills and establishing a treatment plan. This usually involves alcohol treatment specialists. It may include goal setting, behavior change techniques, use of self-help manuals, counseling and follow-up care at a treatment center. - Psychological counseling. Counseling and therapy for groups and individuals help you better understand your problem with alcohol and support recovery from the psychological aspects of alcohol use. You may benefit from couples or family therapy - family support can be an important part of the recovery process. - Oral medications. Naltrexone (Revia), a drug that blocks the good feelings alcohol causes, may prevent heavy drinking and reduce the urge to drink. Acamprosate (Campral) may help combat alcohol cravings once you stop drinking. Disulfiram (Antabuse) may help to prevent you from drinking, though it won&apos;t cure alcohol use disorder or remove the compulsion to drink. If you drink alcohol, the drug produces a physical reaction that may include flushing, nausea, vomiting and headaches. Unlike disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate don&apos;t make you feel sick after taking a drink. - Injected medication. Vivitrol, a version of the drug naltrexone, is injected once a month by a health care professional. Although similar medication can be taken in pill form, the injectable version of the drug may be easier for people recovering from alcohol use disorder to use consistently. - Continuing support. Aftercare programs and support groups help people recovering from alcohol use disorder to stop drinking, manage relapses and cope with necessary lifestyle changes. This may include medical or psychological care or attending a support group. - Treatment for psychological problems. Alcohol use disorder commonly occurs along with other mental health disorders. If you have depression, anxiety or another mental health condition, you may need talk therapy (psychotherapy), medications or other treatment. - Medical treatment for health conditions. Many alcohol-related health problems improve significantly once you stop drinking. But some health conditions may warrant continued treatment and follow-up. - Spiritual practice. People who are involved with some type of regular spiritual practice may find it easier to maintain recovery from alcohol use disorder or other addictions. For many people, gaining greater insight into their spiritual side is a key element in recovery. Residential treatment programs For a serious alcohol problem, you may need a stay at a residential treatment facility. Most residential treatment programs include individual and group therapy, support groups, educational lectures, family involvement and activity therapy. Residential treatment programs typically include licensed alcohol and drug counselors, social workers, nurses, doctors and others with expertise and experience in treating alcohol use disorder.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Alcohol use disorder (Complications): Alcohol depresses your central nervous system. In some people, the initial reaction may be stimulation. But as you continue to drink, you become sedated. Too much alcohol affects your speech, muscle coordination and vital centers of your brain. A heavy drinking binge may even cause a life-threatening coma or death. This is of particular concern when you&apos;re taking certain medications that also depress the brain&apos;s function. Impact on your safety Excessive drinking can reduce your judgment skills and lower inhibitions, leading to poor choices and dangerous situations or behaviors, including: - Motor vehicle accidents and other types of accidental injury, such as drowning - Relationship problems - Poor performance at work or school - Increased likelihood of committing violent crimes or being the victim of a crime - Legal problems or problems with employment or finances - Problems with other substance use - Engaging in risky, unprotected sex, or becoming the victim of sexual abuse or date rape - Increased risk of attempted or completed suicide Impact on your health Drinking too much alcohol on a single occasion or over time can cause health problems, including: - Liver disease. Heavy drinking can cause increased fat in the liver (hepatic steatosis), inflammation of the liver (alcoholic hepatitis), and over time, irreversible destruction and scarring of liver tissue (cirrhosis). - Digestive problems. Heavy drinking can result in inflammation of the stomach lining (gastritis), as well as stomach and esophageal ulcers. It also can interfere with absorption of B vitamins and other nutrients. Heavy drinking can damage your pancreas or lead to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). - Heart problems. Excessive drinking can lead to high blood pressure and increases your risk of an enlarged heart, heart failure or stroke. Even a single binge can cause a serious heart arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation. - Diabetes complications. Alcohol interferes with the release of glucose from your liver and can increase the risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). This is dangerous if you have diabetes and are already taking insulin to lower your blood sugar level. - Sexual function and menstruation issues. Excessive drinking can cause erectile dysfunction in men. In women, it can interrupt menstruation. - Eye problems. Over time, heavy drinking can cause involuntary rapid eye movement (nystagmus) as well as weakness and paralysis of your eye muscles due to a deficiency of vitamin B-1 (thiamine). A thiamine deficiency also can be associated with other brain changes, such as irreversible dementia, if not promptly treated. - Birth defects. Alcohol use during pregnancy may cause miscarriage. It also may cause fetal alcohol syndrome, resulting in giving birth to a child who has physical and developmental problems that last a lifetime. - Bone damage. Alcohol may interfere with the production of new bone. This bone loss can lead to thinning bones (osteoporosis) and an increased risk of fractures. Alcohol can also damage bone marrow, which makes blood cells. This can cause a low platelet count, which may result in bruising and bleeding. - Neurological complications. Excessive drinking can affect your nervous system, causing numbness and pain in your hands and feet, disordered thinking, dementia, and short-term memory loss. - Weakened immune system. Excessive alcohol use can make it harder for your body to resist disease, increasing your risk of various illnesses, especially pneumonia. - Increased risk of cancer. Long-term excessive alcohol use has been linked to a higher risk of many cancers, including mouth, throat, liver, colon and breast cancer. Even moderate drinking can increase the risk of breast cancer. - Medication and alcohol interactions. Some medications interact with alcohol, increasing its toxic effects. Drinking while taking these medications can either increase or decrease their effectiveness, or make them dangerous.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Parkinson disease - discharge: Your doctor has told you that you have Parkinson disease. This disease affects the brain and leads to tremors, problems with walking, movement, and coordination. Other symptoms or problems that may appear later on include difficulty swallowing, constipation, and drooling. Over time, symptoms get worse and it becomes more difficult to take care of yourself. Your doctor may have you take different medicines to treat your Parkinson disease and many of the problems that may come with the disease. - These medicines can cause severe side effects, including hallucinations, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and confusion. - Some medicines can lead to risky behaviors such as gambling. - Make sure you follow instructions. DO NOT stop taking medicines without first talking to your doctor. - Know what to do if you miss a dose. - Keep these and all other medicines stored in a cool, dry place, away from children. Exercise can help your muscles stay strong and help you keep your balance. It is good for your heart. Exercise may also help you sleep better and have regular bowel movements. Pace yourself when you do activities that may be tiring or need a lot of concentration. To stay safe in your home, have someone help you: - Remove things that can cause you to trip. These include throw rugs, loose wires, or cords. - Fix uneven flooring. - Make sure your home has good lighting, especially in hallways. - Install handrails in the bathtub or shower and next to the toilet. - Place a slip-proof mat in the bathtub or shower. - Re-organize your home so things are easier to reach. - Buy a cordless or cell phone so you have it with you when you need to make or receive calls. Your health care provider can refer you to a physical therapist to help with: - Exercises for strength and moving around - How to use your walker, cane, or scooter - How to set up your home to safely move around in and prevent falls - Replace shoe laces and buttons with Velcro - Get a phone with large buttons Constipation is a common problem if you have Parkinson disease. So have a routine. Once you find a bowel routine that works, stick with it. - Pick a regular time, such as after a meal or a warm bath, to try to have a bowel movement. - Be patient. It may take 15 to 30 minutes to have bowel movements. - Try gently rubbing your belly to help stool move through your colon. Also try drinking more fluids, staying active, and eating lots of fiber, including fruits, vegetables, prunes, and cereals. Ask your doctor about medicines you are taking that may cause constipation. These include medicines for depression, pain, bladder control, and muscle spasms. Ask whether you should take a stool softener. These general tips may help with swallowing problems. - Keep mealtime relaxed. Eat small meals, and eat more often. - Sit up straight when you eat. Sit upright for 30 to 45 minutes after eating. - Take small bites. Chew well and swallow your food before taking another bite. - Drink milkshakes and other thick drinks. Eat soft foods that are easy to chew. Or use a blender to prepare your food so that it is easy to swallow. - Ask caregivers and family members not to talk to you when you are eating or drinking. Eat healthy foods, and keep from becoming overweight. Having Parkinson disease may make you feel sad or depressed at times. Talk to friends or family about this. Ask your doctor about seeing a professional to help you with these feelings. Keep up to date with your vaccinations. Get a flu shot every year. Ask your doctor if you need a pneumonia shot. Ask your doctor if it is safe for you to drive. Call your doctor if you have: - Changes in your symptoms or problems with your medicines - Problems moving around or getting out of your bed or chair - Problems with thinking of becoming confused - Pain that is becoming worse - Recent falls - Choking or coughing when eating - Signs of a bladder infection (fever, burning when you urinate, or frequent urination) The American Parkinson Disease Association -- www.apdaparkinson.org The National Parkinson Foundation -- www.parkinson.org Updated by: Joseph V.

				<AnswerURL>https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PARK7</AnswerURL>
				<AnswerText>PARK7 gene (Parkinson disease): Researchers have identified more than 25 PARK7 gene mutations that can cause Parkinson disease, a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement and balance. These mutations are associated with the early-onset form of the disorder, which begins before age 50. Some PARK7 gene mutations lead to an abnormally small DJ-1 protein or change the building blocks (amino acids) used to make the protein. The altered protein is unstable and does not function properly, if at all. Other mutations delete a large portion of the PARK7 gene, preventing the production of any functional DJ-1 protein. It is unclear how loss of functional DJ-1 protein leads to Parkinson disease. Some studies suggest that PARK7 gene mutations disrupt the protein&apos;s chaperone function, which leads to a toxic buildup of misfolded or damaged proteins and eventually to cell death. Another possibility is that PARK7 gene mutations impair the protein&apos;s ability to protect cells from destructive oxidative stress. Nerve cells that make the chemical messenger dopamine are particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress. With diminished protection, free radicals may cause enough damage to kill these nerve cells. Progressive loss of dopamine-producing nerve cells is a characteristic feature of Parkinson disease. The death of these cells weakens communication between the brain and muscles, and ultimately the brain becomes unable to control muscle movement.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerURL>https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/parkinson-disease</AnswerURL>
				<AnswerText>Parkinson disease: Parkinson disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system. The disorder affects several regions of the brain, especially an area called the substantia nigra that controls balance and movement. Often the first symptom of Parkinson disease is trembling or shaking (tremor) of a limb, especially when the body is at rest. Typically, the tremor begins on one side of the body, usually in one hand. Tremors can also affect the arms, legs, feet, and face. Other characteristic symptoms of Parkinson disease include rigidity or stiffness of the limbs and torso, slow movement (bradykinesia) or an inability to move (akinesia), and impaired balance and coordination (postural instability). These symptoms worsen slowly over time. Parkinson disease can also affect emotions and thinking ability (cognition). Some affected individuals develop psychiatric conditions such as depression and visual hallucinations. People with Parkinson disease also have an increased risk of developing dementia, which is a decline in intellectual functions including judgment and memory. Generally, Parkinson disease that begins after age 50 is called late-onset disease. The condition is described as early-onset disease if signs and symptoms begin before age 50. Early-onset cases that begin before age 20 are sometimes referred to as juvenile-onset Parkinson disease. Parkinson disease affects more than 1 million people in North America and more than 4 million people worldwide. In the United States, Parkinson disease occurs in approximately 13 per 100,000 people, and about 60,000 new cases are identified each year. The late-onset form is the most common type of Parkinson disease, and the risk of developing this condition increases with age. Because more people are living longer, the number of people with this disease is expected to increase in coming decades. Most cases of Parkinson disease probably result from a complex interaction of environmental and genetic factors. These cases are classified as sporadic and occur in people with no apparent history of the disorder in their family. The cause of these sporadic cases remains unclear. Approximately 15 percent of people with Parkinson disease have a family history of this disorder. Familial cases of Parkinson disease can be caused by mutations in the LRRK2, PARK7, PINK1, PRKN, or SNCA gene, or by alterations in genes that have not been identified. Mutations in some of these genes may also play a role in cases that appear to be sporadic (not inherited). Alterations in certain genes, including GBA and UCHL1, do not cause Parkinson disease but appear to modify the risk of developing the condition in some families. Variations in other genes that have not been identified probably also contribute to Parkinson disease risk. It is not fully understood how genetic changes cause Parkinson disease or influence the risk of developing the disorder. Many Parkinson disease symptoms occur when nerve cells (neurons) in the substantia nigra die or become impaired. Normally, these cells produce a chemical messenger called dopamine, which transmits signals within the brain to produce smooth physical movements. When these dopamine-producing neurons are damaged or die, communication between the brain and muscles weakens. Eventually, the brain becomes unable to control muscle movement. Some gene mutations appear to disturb the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins in dopamine-producing neurons. As a result, undegraded proteins accumulate, leading to the impairment or death of these cells. Other mutations may affect the function of mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells. As a byproduct of energy production, mitochondria make unstable molecules called free radicals that can damage cells. Cells normally counteract the effects of free radicals before they cause damage, but mutations can disrupt this process. As a result, free radicals may accumulate and impair or kill dopamine-producing neurons. In most cases of Parkinson disease, protein deposits called Lewy bodies appear in dead or dying dopamine-producing neurons. (When Lewy bodies are not present, the condition is sometimes referred to as parkinsonism.) It is unclear whether Lewy bodies play a role in killing nerve cells or if they are part of the cells&apos; response to the disease. Most cases of Parkinson disease occur in people with no apparent family history of the disorder. These sporadic cases may not be inherited, or they may have an inheritance pattern that is unknown. Among familial cases of Parkinson disease, the inheritance pattern differs depending on the gene that is altered. If the LRRK2 or SNCA gene is involved, the disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition. If the PARK7, PINK1, or PRKN gene is involved, Parkinson disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This type of inheritance means that two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Most often, the parents of an individual with autosomal recessive Parkinson disease each carry one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder. When genetic alterations modify the risk of developing Parkinson disease, the inheritance pattern is usually unknown. Abou-Sleiman PM, Muqit MM, Wood NW.

				<AnswerURL>https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PRKN</AnswerURL>
				<AnswerText>PRKN gene (Parkinson disease): Researchers have identified more than 200 PRKN gene mutations that cause Parkinson disease, a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement and balance. Mutations in this gene are associated with the juvenile form of Parkinson disease, which appears before age 20, and some cases of the more common, late-onset form that begins after age 50. Some PRKN gene mutations lead to an abnormally small parkin protein that is nonfunctional and is rapidly broken down (degraded) within cells. Other mutations insert, delete, or change DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the PRKN gene, leading to a defective version of the parkin protein or preventing the production of this protein. The PRKN gene mutations associated with Parkinson disease usually lead to a loss of parkin activity. It is unclear how PRKN gene mutations cause Parkinson disease. The loss of parkin activity probably disturbs the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which allows unneeded proteins to accumulate. A buildup of these proteins could disrupt normal cell activities such as the supply and release of synaptic vesicles, particularly those that contain a chemical messenger called dopamine. As parkin is normally abundant in the brain, its loss could lead to the impairment or death of nerve cells, including those that produce dopamine. Loss of dopamine-producing nerve cells is a characteristic feature of Parkinson disease. Mutations in the PRKN gene may also disrupt the regulation of mitochondria. Researchers speculate that mitochondrial dysfunction in dopamine-producing nerve cells may play an important role in causing the signs and symptoms of Parkinson disease.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Parkinson disease: Parkinson disease causes certain brain cells to die. These are the cells that help control movement and coordination. The disease leads to shaking (tremors) and trouble walking and moving. Nerve cells use a brain chemical called dopamine to help control muscle movement. With Parkinson disease, the brain cells that make dopamine slowly die. Without dopamine, the cells that control movement cannot send messages to the muscles. This makes it hard to control the muscles. Slowly, over time, this damage gets worse. No one knows what causes these brain cells to waste away. Parkinson disease most often develops after age 50. It is one of the most common nervous system problems in older adults. - The disease tends to affect men more than women, although women also develop the disease. Parkinson disease sometimes runs in families. - The disease can occur in younger adults. In such cases, it is often due to the person&apos;s genes. - Parkinson disease is rare in children. Watch this video about: Parkinson disease Symptoms may be mild at first. For instance, you may have a mild tremor or a slight feeling that one leg is stiff and dragging. Symptoms may affect one or both sides of the body. General symptoms may include: - Problems with balance and walking - Rigid or stiff muscles - Muscle aches and pains - Low blood pressure when you stand up - Stooped posture - Constipation - Sweating and not being able to control your body temperature - Slow blinking - Difficulty swallowing - Drooling - Slowed, quieter speech and monotone voice - No expression in your face (like you are wearing a mask) Movement problems may include: - Difficulty starting movement, such as starting to walk or getting out of a chair - Difficulty continuing to move - Slowed movements - Loss of small hand movements (writing may become small and difficult to read) - Difficulty eating Symptoms of shaking (tremors): - Usually occur when your limbs are not moving; this is called resting tremor - Occur when your arm or leg is held out - Go away when you move - May be worse when you are tired, excited, or stressed - Can cause you to rub your finger and thumb together without meaning to (called pill-rolling tremor) - Eventually may occur in your head, lips, tongue, and feet Other symptoms may include: - Anxiety, stress, and tension - Confusion - Dementia - Depression - Fainting - Memory loss Your health care provider may be able to diagnose Parkinson disease based on your symptoms and a physical exam. But the symptoms can be hard to pin down, particularly in older adults. Symptoms are easier to recognize as the illness gets worse. The examination may show: - Difficulty starting or finishing a movement - Jerky, stiff movements - Muscle loss - Shaking (tremors) - Changes in your heart rate - Normal muscle reflexes Your doctor may do some tests to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. There is no cure for Parkinson disease, but treatment can help control your symptoms. MEDICINE Your provider will prescribe medicines to help control your shaking and movement symptoms. At certain times during the day, the medicine may wear off and symptoms can return. If this happens, your provider may need to change any of the following: - Type of medicine - Dose - Amount of time between doses - The way you take the medicine You may also need to take medicines to help with: - Mood and thinking problems - Pain relief - Sleep problems - Drooling (botulinum toxin is often used) Parkinson medicines can cause severe side effects, including: - Confusion - Seeing or hearing things that are not there (hallucinations) - Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea - Feeling lightheaded or fainting - Behaviors that are hard to control, such as gambling - Delirium Tell your provider right away if you have these side effects. Never change or stop taking any medicines without talking with your provider. Stopping some medicines for Parkinson disease may lead to a severe reaction. Work with your provider to find a treatment plan that works for you. As the disease gets worse, symptoms such as stooped posture, frozen movements, and speech problems may not respond to the medicines. SURGERY Surgery may be an option for some people. Surgery does not cure Parkinson disease, but it may help ease symptoms. Types of surgery include: - Deep brain stimulation. This involves placing electric stimulators in areas of the brain that control movement. - Surgery to destroy brain tissue that causes Parkinson symptoms. - Stem cell transplant and other procedures are being studied. LIFESTYLE Certain lifestyle changes may help you cope with Parkinson disease: - Stay healthy by eating nutritious foods and not smoking. - Make changes in what you eat or drink if you have swallowing problems. - Use speech therapy to help you adjust to changes in your swallowing and speech. - Stay active as much as possible when you feel good. DO NOT overdo it when your energy is low. - Rest as needed during the day and avoid stress. - Use physical therapy and occupational therapy to help you stay independent and reduce the risk of falls. - Place handrails throughout your house to help prevent falls. Place them in bathrooms and along stairways. - Use assistive devices, when needed, to make movement easier. These devices may include special eating utensils, wheelchairs, bed lifts, shower chairs, and walkers. - Talk to a social worker or other counseling service to help you and your family cope with the disorder. These services can also help you get outside help, such as Meals on Wheels. Parkinson disease support groups can help you cope with the changes caused by the disease. Medicines can help most people with Parkinson disease. How well medicines relieve symptoms and for how long, can be different in each person. If not treated, the disorder gets worse until a person is totally disabled. Parkinson disease may lead to a decline in brain function and early death. Parkinson disease may cause problems such as: - Difficulty performing daily activities - Difficulty swallowing or eating - Disability (differs from person to person) - Injuries from falls - Pneumonia from breathing in saliva or from choking on food - Side effects of medicines Call your provider if: - You have symptoms of Parkinson disease - Symptoms get worse - New symptoms occur If you take medicines for Parkinson disease, tell your provider about any side effects, which may include: - Changes in alertness, behavior, or mood - Delusional behavior - Dizziness - Hallucinations - Involuntary movements - Loss of mental functions - Nausea and vomiting - Severe confusion or disorientation Also call your provider if the condition gets worse and home care is no longer possible.

				<AnswerText>Secondary parkinsonism: Secondary parkinsonism is similar to Parkinson disease, but the symptoms are caused by certain medicines, a different nervous system disorder, or another illness. Parkinsonism refers to any condition that involves the types of movement problems seen in Parkinson disease. These problems include tremors, slow movement, and stiffness of the arms and legs. Secondary parkinsonism may be caused by health problems, including: - Brain injury - Diffuse Lewy body disease (a type of dementia) - Encephalitis - HIV/AIDS - Meningitis - Multiple system atrophy - Progressive supranuclear palsy - Stroke - Wilson disease Other causes of secondary parkinsonism include: - Brain damage caused by anesthesia drugs (such as during surgery) - Carbon monoxide poisoning - Certain medicines used to treat mental disorders or nausea - Mercury poisoning and other chemical poisonings - Overdoses of narcotics - MPTP (a contaminant in some street drugs) There have been rare cases of secondary parkinsonism among IV drug users who injected a substance called MPTP, which can be produced when making a form of heroin. Common symptoms include: - Decrease in facial expressions - Difficulty starting and controlling movement - Loss or weakness of movement (paralysis) - Soft voice - Stiffness of the trunk, arms, or legs - Tremor Confusion and memory loss may be likely in secondary parkinsonism. This is because many diseases that cause secondary parkinsonism also lead to dementia. The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about the person&apos;s medical history and symptoms. Be aware that the symptoms may be hard to assess, particularly in older adults. Examination may show: - Difficulty starting or stopping voluntary movements - Tense muscles - Problems with posture - Slow, shuffling walk - Tremors (shaking) Reflexes are usually normal. Tests may be ordered to confirm or rule out other problems that can cause similar symptoms. If the condition is caused by a medicine, the provider may recommend changing or stopping the medicine. Treating underlying conditions, such as stroke or infections, can reduce symptoms or prevent the condition from getting worse. If symptoms make it hard to do everyday activities, the provider may recommend medicine. Medicines used to treat this condition can cause severe side effects. It is important to see the provider for check-ups. Secondary parkinsonism tends to be less responsive to medical therapy than Parkinson disease. Unlike Parkinson disease, some types of secondary parkinsonism may stabilize or even improve if the underlying cause is treated. Brain problems, such as Lewy body disease, are not reversible. This condition may lead to these problems: - Difficulty doing daily activities - Difficulty swallowing (eating) - Disability (varying degrees) - Injuries from falls - Side effects of medicines used to treat the condition Side effects from loss of strength (debilitation): - Breathing in food, fluid, or mucus (aspiration) - Blood clot in a deep vein (deep vein thrombosis) - Malnutrition Call the provider if: - Symptoms of secondary parkinsonism develop, come back, or get worse - New symptoms appear, including confusion and movements that cannot be controlled - You are unable to care for the person at home after treatment starts Treating conditions that cause secondary parkinsonism may decrease the risk. People taking medicines that can cause secondary parkinsonism should be carefully monitored by the provider to prevent the condition from developing. Updated by: Joseph V.

				<AnswerText>Parkinson disease: Parkinson disease belongs to a group of conditions called movement disorders. The four main symptoms are tremor, or trembling in hands, arms, legs, jaw, or head; rigidity, or stiffness of the limbs and trunk; bradykinesia, or slowness of movement; and postural instability, or impaired balance. These symptoms usually begin gradually and worsen with time.  As they become more pronounced, patients may have difficulty walking, talking, or completing other simple tasks.  Not everyone with one or more of these symptoms has Parkinson disease, as the symptoms sometimes appear in other diseases as well. [1] Parkinson disease affects about 1 to 2 percent of people over the age of 60 years and the chance of developing Parkinson disease increases as we age. [2] Although some Parkinson disease cases appear to be hereditary most cases are sporadic and occur in people with no apparent history of the disorder in their family. When three or more people are affected in a family, especially if they are diagnosed at an early age (under 50 years)  there may be a gene making this family more likely to develop the condition. Currently, seven genes that cause some form of Parkinson&apos;s disease have been identified. Mutations (changes) in three known genes called SNCA (PARK1),UCHL1 ( PARK 5), and LRRK2 ( PARK8) and another mapped gene ( PARK3) have been reported in families with dominant inheritance. Mutations in three known genes, PARK2 ( PARK2), PARK7 ( PARK7), and PINK1 ( PARK6) have been found in affected individuals who had siblings with the condition but whose parents did not have Parkinson&apos;s disease (recessive inheritance). There is some research to suggest that these genes are also involved in early-onset Parkinson&apos;s disease (diagnosed before the age of 30) or in dominantly inherited Parkinson&apos;s disease but it is too early yet to be certain. However, in most cases inheriting a mutation will not cause someone to develop Parkinson&apos;s disease because there may be additional genes and environmental factors determining who will get the condition, when they get it and how it affects them. [1]  A number of disorders can cause symptoms similar to those of Parkinson disease. People with symptoms that resemble Parkinson disease but that result from other causes are sometimes said to have parkinsonism. Some of these disorders are listed below. [1] Postencephalitic parkinsonism Drug-induced parkinsonism Toxin -induced parkinsonism Arteriosclerotic parkinsonism Parkinsonism- dementia complex of Guam Post-traumatic parkinsonism  Essential tremor Normal pressure hydrocephalus   Progressive supranuclear palsy Corticobasal degeneration  Multiple system atrophy  Dementia with Lewy bodies  More information on each of these conditions is available in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) publication,   Parkinsonian symptoms may also appear in patients with other, clearly distinct neurological disorders such as Wilson disease, Huntington disease, Alzheimer disease, spinocerebellar ataxias, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Each of these disorders has specific features that help to distinguish them from Parkinson disease.[1] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Dysautonomia Occasional Hallucinations Occasional Bradykinesia - Constipation - Dementia - Depressivity - Dysarthria - Dysphagia - Dystonia - Insidious onset - Lewy bodies - Mask-like facies - Neuronal loss in central nervous system - Parkinsonism - Personality changes - Postural instability - Progressive - Resting tremor - Rigidity - Short stepped shuffling gait - Sleep disturbance - Sporadic - Substantia nigra gliosis - Urinary urgency - Weak voice - View complete list of signs and symptoms... Parkinson disease occurs when the nerve cells in the brain that make dopamine, a chemical messenger which transmits signals within the brain to produce smooth physical movements, are slowly destroyed. Without dopamine, the nerve cells in the part of the brain known as the  substantia nigra cannot properly send messages. This leads to progressive loss of muscle function. Exactly why these brain cells waste away is unknown. [1] [3] Recent studies have shown that people with Parkinson disease also experience damage to the nerve endings that produce the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Norepinephrine, which is closely related to dopamine, is the main chemical messenger of the sympathetic nervous system, the part of the nervous system that controls the automatic functions of the body, including pulse and blood pressure. The loss of norepinephrine may explain some of the non-motor features seen in Parkinson disease, including fatigue and problems with blood pressure regulation. [1]  More detailed information about the cause of Parkinson disease is available through an information page developed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). Click here to view this information. Most cases of Parkinson disease are classified as sporadic and occur in people with no apparent history of the disorder in their family. Although the cause of these cases remains unclear, sporadic cases probably result from a complex interaction of environmental and genetic factors. Additionally, certain drugs may cause Parkinson-like symptoms. [4] Approximately 15 percent of people with Parkinson disease have a family history of the disorder. These familial cases are caused by mutations in the , , , , or gene , or by alterations in genes that have not yet been identified. Mutations in some of these genes may also play a role in cases that appear to be sporadic.[4] It is not fully understood how mutations in the , , , , or gene cause Parkinson disease. Some mutations appear to disturb the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins . As a result, un-degraded proteins accumulate, leading to the impairment or death of dopamine-producing neurons. Other mutations may involve mitochondria , the energy-producing structures within cells. As a byproduct of energy production, mitochondria make unstable molecules , called free radicals, that can damage the cell. Normally, the cell neutralizes free radicals, but some gene mutations may disrupt this neutralization process. As a result, free radicals may accumulate and impair or kill dopamine-producing neurons.[4] In some families, alterations in the , , or gene appear to modify the risk of developing Parkinson disease. Researchers have identified some genetic changes that may reduce the risk of developing the disease, while other gene alterations seem to increase the risk.[4] There are currently no blood or laboratory tests that have been proven to help diagnose sporadic cases of Parkinson disease. The diagnosis is generally made after careful evaluation of medical history, current symptoms, and exclusion of other conditions. [1] The clinical findings of tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia are highly suggestive of Parkinson disease. The genetic cause of some forms of Parkinson disease has been identified. In those cases, genetic testing may be utilized to identify affected family members. [5] The resources below provide information about treatment options for this condition.

				<AnswerText>Warning signs and symptoms of heart disease: Heart disease often develops over time. You may have early signs or symptoms long before you have serious heart problems. Or you may not realize you are developing heart disease. The warning signs of heart disease may not be obvious. Also, not every person has the same symptoms. Certain symptoms, such as chest pain, ankle swelling, and shortness of breath may be signals that something is wrong. Learning the warning signs can help you get treatment and help prevent a heart attack or stroke. Chest pain is discomfort or pain that you feel along the front of your body, between your neck and upper abdomen. There are many causes of chest pain that have nothing to do with your heart. But chest pain is still the most common symptom of poor blood flow to the heart or a heart attack. This type of chest pain is called angina. Chest pain can occur when the heart is not getting enough blood or oxygen. The amount and type of pain can vary from person to person. The intensity of the pain does not always relate to how severe the problem is. - Some people may feel a crushing pain, while others feel only mild discomfort. - Your chest may feel heavy or like someone is squeezing your heart. You may also feel a sharp, burning pain in your chest. - You may feel the pain under your breastbone (sternum), or in your neck, arms, stomach, jaw, or upper back. - Chest pain from angina often occurs with activity or emotion, and goes away with rest or a medicine called nitroglycerin. - Bad indigestion can also cause chest pain. Women, older adults, and people with diabetes may have little or no chest pain. They are more likely to have symptoms other than chest pain, such as: - Fatigue - Shortness of breath - General weakness - Change in skin color or greyish pallor (episodes of change in skin color associated with weakness) Other symptoms of a heart attack can include: - Extreme anxiety - Fainting or loss of consciousness - Lightheadedness or dizziness - Nausea or vomiting - Palpitations (feeling like your heart is beating too fast or irregularly) - Shortness of breath - Sweating, which may be very heavy When the heart can&apos;t pump blood as well as it should, blood backs up in the veins that go from the lungs to the heart. Fluid leaks into the lungs and causes shortness of breath. This is a symptom of heart failure. You may notice shortness of breath: - During activity - While you&apos;re resting - When you&apos;re lying flat on your back -- it may even wake you from sleep Coughing or wheezing that doesn&apos;t go away can be another sign that fluid is building up in your lungs. You may also cough up mucus that is pink or bloody. Swelling (edema) in your lower legs is another sign of a heart problem. When your heart doesn&apos;t work as well, blood flow slows and backs up in the veins in your legs. This causes fluid to build up in your tissues. You may also have swelling in your stomach or notice some weight gain. Narrowing of the blood vessels that bring blood to other parts of the body may mean you have a much higher risk for heart attack. It can occur when cholesterol and other fatty material (plaque) build up on the walls of your arteries. Poor blood supply to the legs may lead to: - Pain, achiness, fatigue, burning, or discomfort in the muscles of your feet, calves, or thighs. - Symptoms that often appear during walking or exercise, and go away after several minutes of rest. - Numbness in your legs or feet when you are at rest. Your legs may also feel cool to the touch, and the skin may look pale. A stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain stops. A stroke is sometimes called a &quot;brain attack.&quot; Symptoms of stroke can include difficulty moving the limbs on one side of your body, one side of the face drooping, difficulty with speaking or understanding language. Tiredness can have many causes. Often it simply means that you need more rest. But feeling run down can be a sign of a more serious problem. Fatigue may be a sign of heart trouble when: - You feel much more tired than normal. It&apos;s common for women to feel severely tired before or during a heart attack. - You feel so tired that you can&apos;t do your normal daily activities. - You have sudden, severe weakness. If your heart can&apos;t pump blood as well, it may beat faster to try to keep up. You may feel your heart racing or throbbing. A fast or uneven heartbeat can also be the sign of an arrhythmia. This is a problem with your heart rate or rhythm. If you have any signs of heart disease, call your health care provider right away. Don&apos;t wait to see if the symptoms go away or dismiss them as nothing. Call your local emergency number (such as 911) if: - You have chest pain or other symptoms of a heart attack - If you know you have angina and have chest pain that doesn&apos;t go away after 5 minutes of rest or after taking nitroglycerine - If you think you may be having a heart attack - If you become extremely short of breath - If you think you may have lost consciousness Updated by: Michael A.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available.

[1] Postencephalitic parkinsonism Drug-induced parkinsonism Toxin -induced parkinsonism Arteriosclerotic parkinsonism Parkinsonism- dementia complex of Guam Post-traumatic parkinsonism  Essential tremor Normal pressure hydrocephalus   Progressive supranuclear palsy Corticobasal degeneration  Multiple system atrophy  Dementia with Lewy bodies  More information on each of these conditions is available in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) publication,   Parkinsonian symptoms may also appear in patients with other, clearly distinct neurological disorders such as Wilson disease, Huntington disease, Alzheimer disease, spinocerebellar ataxias, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Each of these disorders has specific features that help to distinguish them from Parkinson disease.[1] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below.

				<AnswerText>Parkinson disease (Treatment): There is no cure for Parkinson disease, but treatment can help control your symptoms. MEDICINE Your provider will prescribe medicines to help control your shaking and movement symptoms. At certain times during the day, the medicine may wear off and symptoms can return. If this happens, your provider may need to change any of the following: - Type of medicine - Dose - Amount of time between doses - The way you take the medicine You may also need to take medicines to help with: - Mood and thinking problems - Pain relief - Sleep problems - Drooling (botulinum toxin is often used) Parkinson medicines can cause severe side effects, including: - Confusion - Seeing or hearing things that are not there (hallucinations) - Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea - Feeling lightheaded or fainting - Behaviors that are hard to control, such as gambling - Delirium Tell your provider right away if you have these side effects. Never change or stop taking any medicines without talking with your provider. Stopping some medicines for Parkinson disease may lead to a severe reaction. Work with your provider to find a treatment plan that works for you. As the disease gets worse, symptoms such as stooped posture, frozen movements, and speech problems may not respond to the medicines. SURGERY Surgery may be an option for some people. Surgery does not cure Parkinson disease, but it may help ease symptoms. Types of surgery include: - Deep brain stimulation. This involves placing electric stimulators in areas of the brain that control movement. - Surgery to destroy brain tissue that causes Parkinson symptoms. - Stem cell transplant and other procedures are being studied. LIFESTYLE Certain lifestyle changes may help you cope with Parkinson disease: - Stay healthy by eating nutritious foods and not smoking. - Make changes in what you eat or drink if you have swallowing problems. - Use speech therapy to help you adjust to changes in your swallowing and speech. - Stay active as much as possible when you feel good. DO NOT overdo it when your energy is low. - Rest as needed during the day and avoid stress. - Use physical therapy and occupational therapy to help you stay independent and reduce the risk of falls. - Place handrails throughout your house to help prevent falls. Place them in bathrooms and along stairways. - Use assistive devices, when needed, to make movement easier. These devices may include special eating utensils, wheelchairs, bed lifts, shower chairs, and walkers. - Talk to a social worker or other counseling service to help you and your family cope with the disorder. These services can also help you get outside help, such as Meals on Wheels.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerURL>https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Epilepsy-Information-Page</AnswerURL>
				<AnswerText>Epilepsy: The epilepsies are a spectrum of brain disorders ranging from severe, life-threatening and disabling, to ones that are much more benign. In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. The epilepsies have many possible causes and there are several types of seizures. Anything that disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activity—from illness to brain damage to abnormal brain development—can lead to seizures. Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, changes in important features of brain cells called channels, or some combination of these and other factors. Having a single seizure as the result of a high fever (called febrile seizure) or head injury does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. Only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. A measurement of electrical activity in the brain and brain scans such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography are common diagnostic tests for epilepsy. Once epilepsy is diagnosed, it is important to begin treatment as soon as possible. For about 70 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. Some drugs are more effective for specific types of seizures. An individual with seizures, particularly those that are not easily controlled, may want to see a neurologist specifically trained to treat epilepsy. In some children, special diets may help to control seizures when medications are either not effective or cause serious side effects. While epilepsy cannot be cured, for some people the seizures can be controlled with medication, diet, devices, and/or surgery. Most seizures do not cause brain damage, but ongoing uncontrolled seizures may cause brain damage. It is not uncommon for people with epilepsy, especially children, to develop behavioral and emotional problems in conjunction with seizures. Issues may also arise as a result of the stigma attached to having epilepsy, which can led to embarrassment and frustration or bullying, teasing, or avoidance in school and other social settings. For many people with epilepsy, the risk of seizures restricts their independence (some states refuse drivers licenses to people with epilepsy) and recreational activities. Epilepsy can be a life-threatening condition. Some people with epilepsy are at special risk for abnormally prolonged seizures or sudden unexplained death in epilepsy.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What is Epilepsy?: Epilepsy is a brain disorder that causes people to have recurring seizures. The seizures happen when clusters of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain send out the wrong signals. People may have strange sensations and emotions or behave strangely. They may have violent muscle spasms or lose consciousness. Epilepsy has many possible causes, including illness, brain injury, and abnormal brain development. In many cases, the cause is unknown. Doctors use brain scans and other tests to diagnose epilepsy. It is important to start treatment right away. There is no cure for epilepsy, but medicines can control seizures for most people. When medicines are not working well, surgery or implanted devices such as vagus nerve stimulators may help. Special diets can help some children with epilepsy.

				<AnswerText>Epilepsy: Epilepsy is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations, and sometimes loss of awareness. Anyone can develop epilepsy. Epilepsy affects both males and females of all races, ethnic backgrounds and ages. Seizure symptoms can vary widely. Some people with epilepsy simply stare blankly for a few seconds during a seizure, while others repeatedly twitch their arms or legs. Having a single seizure doesn&apos;t mean you have epilepsy. At least two unprovoked seizures are generally required for an epilepsy diagnosis. Treatment with medications or sometimes surgery can control seizures for the majority of people with epilepsy. Some people require lifelong treatment to control seizures, but for others, the seizures eventually go away. Some children with epilepsy may outgrow the condition with age. Epilepsy care at Mayo Clinic Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure signs and symptoms may include: - Temporary confusion - A staring spell - Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs - Loss of consciousness or awareness - Psychic symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode. Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how the abnormal brain activity begins. Focal seizures When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they&apos;re called focal (partial) seizures. These seizures fall into two categories: - Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don&apos;t cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. They may also result in involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. - Focal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. During a complex partial seizure, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders. Generalized seizures Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six types of generalized seizures exist. - Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief loss of awareness. - Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground. - Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenly collapse or fall down. - Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms. - Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs. - Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue. When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs: - The seizure lasts more than five minutes. - Breathing or consciousness doesn&apos;t return after the seizure stops. - A second seizure follows immediately. - You have a high fever. - You&apos;re experiencing heat exhaustion. - You&apos;re pregnant. - You have diabetes. - You&apos;ve injured yourself during the seizure. If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice. Epilepsy has no identifiable cause in about half the people with the condition. In the other half, the condition may be traced to various factors, including: - Genetic influence. Some types of epilepsy, which are categorized by the type of seizure you experience or the part of the brain that is affected, run in families. In these cases, it&apos;s likely that there&apos;s a genetic influence. Researchers have linked some types of epilepsy to specific genes, but for most people, genes are only part of the cause of epilepsy. Certain genes may make a person more sensitive to environmental conditions that trigger seizures. - Head trauma. Head trauma as a result of a car accident or other traumatic injury can cause epilepsy. - Brain conditions. Brain conditions that cause damage to the brain, such as brain tumors or strokes, can cause epilepsy. Stroke is a leading cause of epilepsy in adults older than age 35. - Infectious diseases. Infectious diseases, such as meningitis, AIDS and viral encephalitis, can cause epilepsy. - Prenatal injury. Before birth, babies are sensitive to brain damage that could be caused by several factors, such as an infection in the mother, poor nutrition or oxygen deficiencies. This brain damage can result in epilepsy or cerebral palsy. - Developmental disorders. Epilepsy can sometimes be associated with developmental disorders, such as autism and neurofibromatosis. Certain factors may increase your risk of epilepsy: - Age. The onset of epilepsy is most common in children and older adults, but the condition can occur at any age. - Family history. If you have a family history of epilepsy, you may be at an increased risk of developing a seizure disorder. - Head injuries. Head injuries are responsible for some cases of epilepsy. You can reduce your risk by wearing a seat belt while riding in a car and by wearing a helmet while bicycling, skiing, riding a motorcycle or engaging in other activities with a high risk of head injury. - Stroke and other vascular diseases. Stroke and other blood vessel (vascular) diseases can lead to brain damage that may trigger epilepsy. You can take a number of steps to reduce your risk of these diseases, including limiting your intake of alcohol and avoiding cigarettes, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. - Dementia. Dementia can increase the risk of epilepsy in older adults. - Brain infections. Infections such as meningitis, which causes inflammation in your brain or spinal cord, can increase your risk. - Seizures in childhood. High fevers in childhood can sometimes be associated with seizures. Children who have seizures due to high fevers generally won&apos;t develop epilepsy. The risk of epilepsy increases if a child has a long seizure, another nervous system condition or a family history of epilepsy. To diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your symptoms and medical history. Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose epilepsy and determine the cause of seizures. Your evaluation may include: - A neurological exam. Your doctor may test your behavior, motor abilities, mental function and other areas to diagnose your condition and determine the type of epilepsy you may have. - Blood tests. Your doctor may take a blood sample to check for signs of infections, genetic conditions or other conditions that may be associated with seizures. Your doctor may also suggest tests to detect brain abnormalities, such as: - Electroencephalogram (EEG). This is the most common test used to diagnose epilepsy. In this test, doctors attach electrodes to your scalp with a paste-like substance. The electrodes record the electrical activity of your brain. If you have epilepsy, it&apos;s common to have changes in your normal pattern of brain waves, even when you&apos;re not having a seizure. Your doctor may monitor you on video while conducting an EEG while you&apos;re awake or asleep, to record any seizures you experience. Recording the seizures may help the doctor determine what kind of seizures you&apos;re having or rule out other conditions. Your doctor may give you instructions to do something that will cause seizures, such as getting little sleep prior to the test. - High-density EEG. In a variation of an EEG test, your doctor may recommend high-density EEG, which spaces electrodes more closely than conventional EEG - about a half a centimeter apart. High-density EEG may help your doctor more precisely determine which areas of your brain are affected by seizures. - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of your brain. CT scans can reveal abnormalities in your brain that might be causing your seizures, such as tumors, bleeding and cysts. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a detailed view of your brain. Your doctor may be able to detect lesions or abnormalities in your brain that could be causing your seizures. - Functional MRI (fMRI). A functional MRI measures the changes in blood flow that occur when specific parts of your brain are working. Doctors may use an fMRI before surgery to identify the exact locations of critical functions, such as speech and movement, so that surgeons can avoid injuring those places while operating. - Positron emission tomography (PET). PET scans use a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that&apos;s injected into a vein to help visualize active areas of the brain and detect abnormalities. - Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). This type of test is used primarily if you&apos;ve had an MRI and EEG that didn&apos;t pinpoint the location in your brain where the seizures are originating. A SPECT test uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that&apos;s injected into a vein to create a detailed, 3-D map of the blood flow activity in your brain during seizures. Doctors also may conduct a form of a SPECT test called subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI (SISCOM), which may provide even more-detailed results. - Neuropsychological tests. In these tests, doctors assess your thinking, memory and speech skills. The test results help doctors determine which areas of your brain are affected. Along with your test results, your doctor may use a combination of analysis techniques to help pinpoint where in the brain seizures start: - Statistical parametric mapping (SPM). SPM is a method of comparing areas of the brain that have increased metabolism during seizures to normal brains, which can give doctors an idea of where seizures begin. - Curry analysis. Curry analysis is a technique that takes EEG data and projects it onto an MRI of the brain to show doctors where seizures are occurring. - Magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG measures the magnetic fields produced by brain activity to identify potential areas of seizure onset. Accurate diagnosis of your seizure type and where seizures begin gives you the best chance for finding an effective treatment. Doctors generally begin by treating epilepsy with medication. If medications don&apos;t treat the condition, doctors may propose surgery or another type of treatment. Medication Most people with epilepsy can become seizure-free by taking one anti-seizure medication, which is also called anti-epileptic medication. Others may be able to decrease the frequency and intensity of their seizures by taking a combination of medications. Many children with epilepsy who aren&apos;t experiencing epilepsy symptoms can eventually discontinue medications and live a seizure-free life. Many adults can discontinue medications after two or more years without seizures. Your doctor will advise you about the appropriate time to stop taking medications. Finding the right medication and dosage can be complex. Your doctor will consider your condition, frequency of seizures, your age and other factors when choosing which medication to prescribe. Your doctor will also review any other medications you may be taking, to ensure the anti-epileptic medications won&apos;t interact with them. Your doctor likely will first prescribe a single medication at a relatively low dosage and may increase the dosage gradually until your seizures are well-controlled. Anti-seizure medications may have some side effects. Mild side effects include: - Fatigue - Dizziness - Weight gain - Loss of bone density - Skin rashes - Loss of coordination - Speech problems - Memory and thinking problems More-severe but rare side effects include: - Depression - Suicidal thoughts and behaviors - Severe rash - Inflammation of certain organs, such as your liver To achieve the best seizure control possible with medication, follow these steps: - Take medications exactly as prescribed. - Always call your doctor before switching to a generic version of your medication or taking other prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs or herbal remedies. - Never stop taking your medication without talking to your doctor. - Notify your doctor immediately if you notice new or increased feelings of depression, suicidal thoughts, or unusual changes in your mood or behaviors. - Tell your doctor if you have migraines. Doctors may prescribe one of the anti-epileptic medications that can prevent your migraines and treat epilepsy. At least half the people newly diagnosed with epilepsy will become seizure-free with their first medication. If anti-epileptic medications don&apos;t provide satisfactory results, your doctor may suggest surgery or other therapies. You&apos;ll have regular follow-up appointments with your doctor to evaluate your condition and medications. Surgery When medications fail to provide adequate control over seizures, surgery may be an option. With epilepsy surgery, a surgeon removes the area of your brain that&apos;s causing seizures. Doctors usually perform surgery when tests show that: - Your seizures originate in a small, well-defined area of your brain - The area in your brain to be operated on doesn&apos;t interfere with vital functions such as speech, language, motor function, vision or hearing Although many people continue to need some medication to help prevent seizures after successful surgery, you may be able to take fewer drugs and reduce your dosages. In a small number of cases, surgery for epilepsy can cause complications such as permanently altering your thinking (cognitive) abilities. Talk to your surgeon about his or her experience, success rates, and complication rates with the procedure you&apos;re considering. Therapies Apart from medications and surgery, these potential therapies offer an alternative for treating epilepsy: - Vagus nerve stimulation. In vagus nerve stimulation, doctors implant a device called a vagus nerve stimulator underneath the skin of your chest, similar to a heart pacemaker. Wires from the stimulator are connected to the vagus nerve in your neck. The battery-powered device sends bursts of electrical energy through the vagus nerve and to your brain. It&apos;s not clear how this inhibits seizures, but the device can usually reduce seizures by 20 to 40 percent. Most people still need to take anti-epileptic medication, although some people may be able to lower their medication dose. You may experience side effects from vagus nerve stimulation, such as throat pain, hoarse voice, shortness of breath or coughing. - Ketogenic diet. Some children with epilepsy have been able to reduce their seizures by following a strict diet that&apos;s high in fats and low in carbohydrates. In this diet, called a ketogenic diet, the body breaks down fats instead of carbohydrates for energy. After a few years, some children may be able to stop the ketogenic diet - under close supervision of their doctors - and remain seizure-free. Consult a doctor if you or your child is considering a ketogenic diet. It&apos;s important to make sure that your child doesn&apos;t become malnourished when following the diet. Side effects of a ketogenic diet may include dehydration, constipation, slowed growth because of nutritional deficiencies and a buildup of uric acid in the blood, which can cause kidney stones. These side effects are uncommon if the diet is properly and medically supervised. Following a ketogenic diet can be a challenge. Low-glycemic index and modified Atkins diets offer less restrictive alternatives that may still provide some benefit for seizure control. Potential future treatments Researchers are studying many potential new treatments for epilepsy, including: - Deep brain stimulation. In deep brain stimulation, surgeons implant electrodes into a specific part of your brain, typically your thalamus. The electrodes are connected to a generator implanted in your chest or the skull that sends electrical pulses to your brain and may reduce your seizures. - Responsive neurostimulation. Implantable, pacemaker-like devices that help prevent seizures are also under investigation. These responsive stimulation or closed loop devices analyze brain activity patterns to detect seizures before they happen and deliver an electrical charge or drug to stop the seizure. - Continuous stimulation of the seizure onset zone (subthreshold stimulation). Subthreshold stimulation - continuous stimulation to an area of your brain below a level that&apos;s physically noticeable - appears to improve seizure outcomes and quality of life for some people with seizures. This treatment approach may work in people who have seizures that start in an area of the brain that can&apos;t be removed because it would affect speech and motor functions (eloquent area). Or it might benefit people whose seizure characteristics mean their chances of successful treatment with responsive neurostimulation are low. - Minimally invasive surgery. New minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as MRI-guided laser ablation, show promise at reducing seizures with fewer risks than traditional open brain surgery for epilepsy. - Stereotactic laser ablation or radiosurgery. For some types of epilepsy, stereotactic laser ablation or stereotactic radiosurgery may provide effective treatment for people in which an open procedure may be too risky. In these procedures, doctors direct radiation at the specific area in the brain causing seizures, to destroy that tissue in an effort to better control the seizures. - External nerve stimulation device. Similar to vagus nerve stimulation, this device would stimulate specific nerves to reduce frequency of seizures. But unlike vagus nerve stimulation, this device would be worn externally so that no surgery to implant the device is needed. Understanding your condition can help you take better control of it: - Take your medication correctly. Don&apos;t adjust your dosage before talking to your doctor. If you feel your medication should be changed, discuss it with your doctor. - Get enough sleep. Lack of sleep can trigger seizures. Be sure to get adequate rest every night. - Wear a medical alert bracelet. This will help emergency personnel know how to treat you correctly. - Exercise. Exercising may help keep you physically healthy and reduce depression. Make sure to drink enough water, and rest if you get tired during exercise. In addition, make healthy life choices, such as managing stress, limiting alcoholic beverages and avoiding cigarettes.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Epilepsy - overview: Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which a person has repeated seizures over time. Seizures are episodes of uncontrolled and abnormal firing of brain cells that may cause changes in attention or behavior. Epilepsy occurs when permanent changes in the brain cause it to be too excitable or irritable. As a result, the brain sends out abnormal signals. This leads to repeated, unpredictable seizures. (A single seizure that does not happen again is not epilepsy.) Epilepsy may be due to a medical condition or injury that affects the brain. Or the cause may be unknown (idiopathic). Common causes of epilepsy include: - Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) - Dementia, such as Alzheimer disease - Traumatic brain injury - Infections, including brain abscess, meningitis, encephalitis, and HIV/AIDS - Brain problems that are present at birth (congenital brain defect) - Brain injury that occurs during or near birth - Metabolism disorders present at birth (such as phenylketonuria) - Brain tumor - Abnormal blood vessels in the brain - Other illness that damages or destroys brain tissue Epileptic seizures usually begin between ages 5 and 20. There is also a higher chance of seizures in adults older than 60. But epileptic seizures can happen at any age. There may be a family history of seizures or epilepsy. Symptoms vary from person to person. Some people may have simple staring spells. Others have violent shaking and loss of alertness. The type of seizure depends on the part of the brain that is affected. Most of the time, the seizure is similar to the one before it. Some people with epilepsy have a strange sensation before each seizure. Sensations may be tingling, smelling an odor that is not actually there, or emotional changes. This is called an aura. Your doctor can tell you more about the specific type of seizure you may have: - Absence (petit mal) seizure (staring spells) - Generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure (involves the entire body, including aura, rigid muscles, and loss of alertness) - Partial (focal) seizure (can involve any of the symptoms described above, depending on where in the brain the seizure starts) The doctor will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at the brain and nervous system. An EEG (electroencephalogram) will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with epilepsy often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures. To diagnose epilepsy or plan for epilepsy surgery, you may need to: - Wear an EEG recorder for days or weeks as you go about your everyday life. - Stay in a special hospital where brain activity can be recorded while video cameras capture what happens to you during the seizure. This is called video EEG. Tests that may be done include: - Blood chemistry - Blood sugar - Complete blood count (CBC) - Kidney function tests - Liver function tests - Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) - Tests for infectious diseases Head CT or MRI scan is often done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. Treatment for epilepsy includes taking medicines, lifestyle changes, and sometimes surgery. If epilepsy is due to a tumor, abnormal blood vessels, or bleeding in the brain, surgery to treat these disorders may make the seizures stop. Medicines to prevent seizures, called anticonvulsants (or antiepileptic drugs), may reduce the number of future seizures: - These drugs are taken by mouth. Which type you are prescribed depends on the type of seizures you have. - Your dosage may need to be changed from time to time. You may need regular blood tests to check for side effects. - Always take your medicine on time and as directed. Missing a dose can cause you to have a seizure. DO NOT stop taking or change medicines on your own. Talk to your doctor first. - Many epilepsy medicines cause birth defects. Women who plan to become pregnant should tell their doctor in advance in order to adjust medicines. Many epilepsy drugs may affect the health of your bones. Talk to your doctor about whether you need vitamins and other supplements. Epilepsy that does not get better after 2 or 3 anti-seizure drugs have been tried is called &quot;medically refractory epilepsy.&quot; In this case, the doctor may recommend surgery to: - Remove the abnormal brain cells causing the seizures. - Place a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS). This device is similar to a heart pacemaker. It can help reduce the number of seizures. Some children are placed on a special diet to help prevent seizures. The most popular one is the ketogenic diet. A diet low in carbohydrates, such as the Atkins diet, may also be helpful in some adults. Be sure to discuss these options with your doctor before trying them. Lifestyle or medical changes can increase the risk for a seizure in adults and children with epilepsy. Talk with your doctor about: - New prescribed drugs, vitamins, or supplements - Emotional stress - Illness, especially infection - Lack of sleep - Pregnancy - Skipping doses of epilepsy medicines - Use of alcohol or other recreational drugs Other considerations: - People with epilepsy should wear medical alert jewelry so that prompt treatment can be obtained if a seizure occurs. - People with poorly controlled epilepsy should not drive. Check your state&apos;s law about which people with a history of seizures are allowed to drive. - DO NOT use machinery or do activities that can cause loss of awareness, such as climbing to high places, biking, and swimming alone. The stress of having epilepsy or being a caretaker of someone with epilepsy can often be helped by joining a support group. In these groups, members share common experiences and problems. Some people with epilepsy may be able to reduce or even stop their anti-seizure medicines after having no seizures for several years. Certain types of childhood epilepsy go away or improve with age, usually in the late teens or 20s. For many people, epilepsy is a lifelong condition. In these cases, anti-seizure drugs need to be continued. There is a very low risk for sudden death with epilepsy. Complications may include: - Difficulty learning - Breathing in food or saliva into the lungs during a seizure, which can cause aspiration pneumonia - Injury from falls, bumps, self-inflicted bites, driving or operating machinery during a seizure - Permanent brain damage (stroke or other damage) - Side effects of medicines Call your local emergency number (such as 911) if: - This is the first time a person has a seizure - A seizure occurs in someone who is not wearing a medical ID bracelet (which has instructions explaining what to do) In the case of someone who has had seizures before, call 911 for any of these emergency situations: - This is a longer seizure than the person normally has, or an unusual number of seizures for the person - Repeated seizures over a few minutes - Repeated seizures in which consciousness or normal behavior is not regained between them (status epilepticus) Call your doctor if any new symptoms occur: - Loss of hair - Nausea or vomiting - Rash - Side effects of medicines, such as drowsiness, restlessness, confusion, sedation - Tremors or abnormal movements, or problems with coordination There is no known way to prevent epilepsy. Proper diet and sleep, and staying away from alcohol and illegal drugs may decrease the likelihood of triggering seizures in people with epilepsy. Reduce the risk for head injury by wearing a helmet during risky activities. This can lessen the likelihood of a brain injury that leads to seizures and epilepsy. Updated by: Amit M.

				<AnswerText>Epilepsy - children: Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which a person has repeated seizures over time. A seizure is a sudden change in the electrical and chemical activity in the brain. A single seizure that does not happen again is NOT epilepsy. Epilepsy may be due to a medical condition or injury that affects the brain. Or the cause may be unknown. Common causes of epilepsy include: - Traumatic brain injury - Damage or scarring after infections of the brain - Birth defects that involve the brain - Brain injury that occurs during or near birth - Metabolic disorders present at birth (such as phenylketonuria) - Benign brain tumor, often very small - Abnormal blood vessels in the brain - Stroke - Other illnesses that damage or destroy brain tissue Epileptic seizures usually start between ages 5 and 20. But they can happen at any age. There may be a family history of seizures or epilepsy. A febrile seizure is a convulsion in a child triggered by a fever. Most of the time, a febrile seizure is not a sign that the child has epilepsy. Symptoms vary from child to child. Some children may simply stare. Others may shake violently and lose alertness. The movements or symptoms of a seizure may depend on the part of the brain that is affected. Your child&apos;s health care provider can tell you more about the specific type of seizure your child may have: - Absence (petit mal) seizure: Staring spells - Generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure: Involves the entire body, including aura, rigid muscles, and loss of alertness - Partial (focal) seizure: Can involve any of the symptoms described above, depending on where in the brain the seizure starts Most of the time, the seizure is similar to the one before it. Some children have a strange sensation before a seizure. Sensations may be tingling, smelling an odor that is not actually there, feeling fear or anxiety for no reason or having a sense of déjà vu (feeling that something has happened before). This is called an aura. The provider will: - Ask about your child&apos;s medical and family history in detail - Ask about the seizure episode - Do a physical exam of your child, including a detailed look at the brain and nervous system The provider will order an EEG (electroencephalogram) to check the electrical activity in the brain. This test often shows any abnormal electrical activity in the brain. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures. To diagnose epilepsy or plan for epilepsy surgery, your child may need to: - Wear an EEG recorder for few days during day-to-day activities - Stay in the hospital where brain activity can be watched on video cameras (video EEG) The provider also may order other tests, including: - Blood chemistry - Blood sugar - Complete blood count (CBC) - Kidney function tests - Liver function tests - Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) - Tests for infectious diseases Head CT or MRI scan are often done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. Much less often, PET scan of the brain is needed to help plan surgery. Treatment for epilepsy includes: - Medicines - Lifestyle changes - Surgery If your child&apos;s epilepsy is due to a tumor, abnormal blood vessels, or bleeding in the brain, surgery may be needed. Medicines to prevent seizures are called anticonvulsants or antiepileptic drugs. These may reduce the number of future seizures. - These medicines are taken by mouth.

The provider may order regular blood tests to check for side effects. - Always make sure your child takes the medicine on time and as directed. Missing a dose can cause your child to have a seizure. Do NOT stop or change medicines on your own. Talk to the provider first. Many epilepsy drugs may affect your child&apos;s bone health. Talk to your child&apos;s provider about whether your child needs vitamins and other supplements. Epilepsy that is not well controlled after trying a number of antiseizure drugs is called &quot;medically refractory epilepsy.&quot; In this case, the doctor may recommend surgery to: - Remove the abnormal brain cells causing the seizures. - Place a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS). This device is similar to a heart pacemaker. It can help reduce the number of seizures. Some children are placed on a special diet to help prevent seizures. The most popular one is the ketogenic diet. A diet low in carbohydrates, such as the Atkins diet, also may be helpful. Be sure to discuss these options with your child&apos;s provider before trying them. Epilepsy is often a lifelong or chronic illness. Important management issues include: - Taking medicines - Staying safe, such as never swimming alone, fall-proofing your home and so on  - Managing stress and sleep - Avoiding alcohol and drug abuse - Keeping up in school - Managing other illnesses Managing these lifestyle or medical issues at home can be a challenge. The stress of being a caretaker of a child with epilepsy can often be helped by joining a support group. In these groups, members share common experiences and problems. Most children with epilepsy live a normal life. Certain types of childhood epilepsy go away or improve with age, usually in the late teens or 20s. If your child does not have seizures for a few years, the provider may stop medicines. For many children, epilepsy is a lifelong condition. In these cases, the medicines need to be continued. Children who have developmental disorders that also cause epilepsy may face challenges throughout their life. Knowing more about the condition will help you take better care of your child&apos;s epilepsy. Complications may include: - Difficulty learning - Breathing in food or saliva into the lungs during a seizure, which can cause aspiration pneumonia - Irregular heartbeat - Injury from falls, bumps, or self-caused bites during a seizure - Permanent brain damage (stroke or other damage) - Side effects of medicines Call your local emergency number (such as 911) if: - This is the first time your child has a seizure - A seizure occurs in a child who is not wearing a medical ID bracelet (which has instructions explaining what to do) If your child has had seizures before, call 911 for any of these emergency situations: - The seizure is longer than the child normally has or the child has an unusual number of seizures - The child has repeated seizures over a few minutes - The child has repeated seizures in which consciousness or normal behavior is not regained between them (status epilepticus) - The child gets injured during the seizure - The child has difficulty breathing Call the provider if your child has new symptoms: - Nausea or vomiting - Rash - Side effects of medicines, such as drowsiness, restlessness, or confusion - Tremors or abnormal movements, or problems with coordination Contact the provider even if your child is normal after the seizure has stopped. There is no known way to prevent epilepsy. Proper diet and sleep may decrease the chances of seizures in children with epilepsy. Reduce the risk of head injury during risky activities. This can decrease the likelihood of a brain injury that leads to seizures and epilepsy. Updated by: Neil K.

				<AnswerText>Epilepsy juvenile absence: The following summary is from Orphanet, a European reference portal for information on rare diseases and orphan drugs. Orpha Number: 1941 Disease definition Juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) is a genetic epilepsy with onset occurring around puberty. JAE is characterized by sporadic occurrence of absence seizures , frequently associated with a long-life prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and sporadic myoclonic jerks. Epidemiology The incidence of JAE is still unknown but it accounts for approximately 2-3% of patients with adult epilepsy in general, and about 8-10% of patients with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). No sex predominance has been observed. Clinical description JAE is characterized by sporadic occurrence of absence seizures (only one or a few absences daily; 100% of cases), frequently associated with a long-life prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS; 80%) and sporadic myoclonic jerks (20%). The seizures onset is typically between 9 and 13 years of age and it manifests as a &apos;&apos;staring spell&apos;&apos; that can be accompanied by atonic postures such as drooping of the head and/or automatisms such as lip smacking. GTCS and myoclonic seizures often occur 1-10 years after the absence seizure onset. Patients with JAE usually develop normally, although uncontrolled absence seizures may have an impact on their ability to learn at school. Etiology The exact etiology of JAE is still elusive. However, genetic mutations for voltage-gated sodium channels ( CACNB4 gene (2q22-q23)), potassium channels ( CLCN2 gene (3q27.1)), and EFHC1 (6p12.3) may be involved in a subset of patients. Moreover, different mutations have been found in genes for GABA receptors (ligand ion channels), specifically in the GABRA1 gene (5q34). Diagnostic methods Diagnosis relies on the clinical features and on electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded awake and during sleep, that displays a generalized 3-4 Hz spike-and-slow-wave complexes. Differential diagnosis Differential diagnosis includes childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, Jeavons syndrome (see these terms). Genetic counseling The transmission is still unknown although an increased risk for first degree related parents to develop JME may exist. Management and treatment The antiepileptic drugs of choice are valproic acid (VPA) and lamotrigine (LTG). In cases where VPA deals with only partial seizure control, add-on of LTG (GTCS) or ethosuximide (absence seizures) can be beneficial. Prognosis Prognosis of JAE is usually favorable with good therapy responsiveness. Generally, seizure freedom can be achieved with antiepileptic medication in 62-84% of all patients with JAE. However, the occurrence of GTCS predicts a worse prognosis. Visit the Orphanet disease page for more resources. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency).

				<AnswerURL>https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/2166/epilepsy-occipital-calcifications</AnswerURL>
				<AnswerText>Epilepsy occipital calcifications: The following summary is from Orphanet, a European reference portal for information on rare diseases and orphan drugs. Orpha Number: 1459 Disease definition Celiac disease, epilepsy and cerebral calcification syndrome (CEC) is a rare disorder characterized by the combination of auto-immune intestinal disease, epileptic seizures and cerebral calcifications. Epidemiology CEC was first described in 1992 and fewer than 200 cases have been reported so far. Clinical description Celiac disease (CD, see this term) and epilepsy manifest at a variable age, and CD is frequently diagnosed in late childhood, when specific investigations are performed secondary to observation of epileptic seizures and cerebral calcifications (CC). CD can present in a typical form characterized by onset in the first 2 years of life, chronic diarrhea, weight loss, short stature , anorexia, and, in some cases, irritability and vomiting. CD may also present in silent or latent forms, which are characterized - in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms - by dermatitis herpetiformis, dental enamel defects or autoimmune thyroiditis. In CEC patients, CD usually evolves into latent, silent or paucisymptomatic forms. Epilepsy onset is between infancy and adulthood; most cases occur in early childhood. Most patients present with occipital epileptic seizures, the course being highly variable, with benign, drug-resistant, or epileptic encephalopathy forms. In the latter, severe mental deterioration and/or learning disorders have been reported while a mild mental deterioration is observed in only one third of all CEC cases. CCs are seen in subcortical parieto-occipital regions. CC size does not change significantly over time, but in several cases, new CCs appeared in other regions. Patients with CCs and CD without epilepsy are considered as having an incomplete form of CEC. Some patients with epilepsy and CC without CD are considered to have a CEC with latent CD. Etiology Etiology of CEC is unclear. It is not known if epilepsy and/or CC are a consequence of CD. CD is an immune auto-inflammatory reaction occurring in predisposed gluten-intolerant individuals. It originates from the jejunal mucosa and spreads to the lamina propria, leading to the observed histopathological features (crypt hyperplasia, jejunal villous atrophy and inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria). CD may induce autoimmune responses outside the gastrointestinal tract. Circulating activated T cells may cross the blood-brain barrier and be toxic to myelin or myelin-producing cells. As for isolated CD, CEC is associated with the HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 genes . Diagnostic methods Diagnosis relies on anamnestic investigation and EEG to characterize epileptic seizures. Computed tomography (CT) imaging reveals CC. Laboratory findings (antiendomisium antibodies , antigliadin antibodies, anti- tissue -transglutaminase type 2 antibodies, HLA phenotype ), and histopathological analysis of small bowel biopsy (jejunal mucosa villous atrophy) enable identification of silent or latent CD in a patient with epileptic seizures and CC. Differential diagnosis Differential diagnosis of CEC includes Sturge-Weber syndrome (see this term) without nevus flammeus and other conditions such as congenital folate malabsorption or adverse effects of methotrexate, antifolate agents and radiotherapy of leukemic children. Management and treatment CD requires life-long observance of a gluten-free diet (GFD), leading to clinical and histopathological resolution of symptoms. A study has revealed that early CD diagnosis and treatment by GFD could prevent or reverse the epileptic disorder. Prognosis Early diagnosis and good compliance of GFD greatly improve outcome. On the contrary, if treatment is delayed, epilepsy may be more severe and epileptic encephalopathy may develop. Visit the Orphanet disease page for more resources.

				<AnswerText>What is Epilepsy?: The epilepsies are a spectrum of brain disorders ranging from severe, life-threatening and disabling, to ones that are much more benign. In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. The epilepsies have many possible causes and there are several types of seizures. Anything that disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activityfrom illness to brain damage to abnormal brain developmentcan lead to seizures. Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, changes in important features of brain cells called channels, or some combination of these and other factors. Having a single seizure as the result of a high fever (called febrile seizure) or head injury does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. Only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. A measurement of electrical activity in the brain and brain scans such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography are common diagnostic tests for epilepsy.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Epilepsy juvenile absence (Summary): The following summary is from Orphanet, a European reference portal for information on rare diseases and orphan drugs. Orpha Number: 1941 Disease definition Juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) is a genetic epilepsy with onset occurring around puberty. JAE is characterized by sporadic occurrence of absence seizures , frequently associated with a long-life prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and sporadic myoclonic jerks. Epidemiology The incidence of JAE is still unknown but it accounts for approximately 2-3% of patients with adult epilepsy in general, and about 8-10% of patients with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). No sex predominance has been observed. Clinical description JAE is characterized by sporadic occurrence of absence seizures (only one or a few absences daily; 100% of cases), frequently associated with a long-life prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS; 80%) and sporadic myoclonic jerks (20%). The seizures onset is typically between 9 and 13 years of age and it manifests as a &apos;&apos;staring spell&apos;&apos; that can be accompanied by atonic postures such as drooping of the head and/or automatisms such as lip smacking. GTCS and myoclonic seizures often occur 1-10 years after the absence seizure onset. Patients with JAE usually develop normally, although uncontrolled absence seizures may have an impact on their ability to learn at school. Etiology The exact etiology of JAE is still elusive. However, genetic mutations for voltage-gated sodium channels ( CACNB4 gene (2q22-q23)), potassium channels ( CLCN2 gene (3q27.1)), and EFHC1 (6p12.3) may be involved in a subset of patients. Moreover, different mutations have been found in genes for GABA receptors (ligand ion channels), specifically in the GABRA1 gene (5q34). Diagnostic methods Diagnosis relies on the clinical features and on electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded awake and during sleep, that displays a generalized 3-4 Hz spike-and-slow-wave complexes. Differential diagnosis Differential diagnosis includes childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, Jeavons syndrome (see these terms). Genetic counseling The transmission is still unknown although an increased risk for first degree related parents to develop JME may exist. Management and treatment The antiepileptic drugs of choice are valproic acid (VPA) and lamotrigine (LTG). In cases where VPA deals with only partial seizure control, add-on of LTG (GTCS) or ethosuximide (absence seizures) can be beneficial. Prognosis Prognosis of JAE is usually favorable with good therapy responsiveness. Generally, seizure freedom can be achieved with antiepileptic medication in 62-84% of all patients with JAE. However, the occurrence of GTCS predicts a worse prognosis. Visit the Orphanet disease page for more resources.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Epilepsy occipital calcifications (Summary): The following summary is from Orphanet, a European reference portal for information on rare diseases and orphan drugs. Orpha Number: 1459 Disease definition Celiac disease, epilepsy and cerebral calcification syndrome (CEC) is a rare disorder characterized by the combination of auto-immune intestinal disease, epileptic seizures and cerebral calcifications. Epidemiology CEC was first described in 1992 and fewer than 200 cases have been reported so far. Clinical description Celiac disease (CD, see this term) and epilepsy manifest at a variable age, and CD is frequently diagnosed in late childhood, when specific investigations are performed secondary to observation of epileptic seizures and cerebral calcifications (CC). CD can present in a typical form characterized by onset in the first 2 years of life, chronic diarrhea, weight loss, short stature , anorexia, and, in some cases, irritability and vomiting. CD may also present in silent or latent forms, which are characterized - in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms - by dermatitis herpetiformis, dental enamel defects or autoimmune thyroiditis. In CEC patients, CD usually evolves into latent, silent or paucisymptomatic forms. Epilepsy onset is between infancy and adulthood; most cases occur in early childhood. Most patients present with occipital epileptic seizures, the course being highly variable, with benign, drug-resistant, or epileptic encephalopathy forms. In the latter, severe mental deterioration and/or learning disorders have been reported while a mild mental deterioration is observed in only one third of all CEC cases. CCs are seen in subcortical parieto-occipital regions. CC size does not change significantly over time, but in several cases, new CCs appeared in other regions. Patients with CCs and CD without epilepsy are considered as having an incomplete form of CEC. Some patients with epilepsy and CC without CD are considered to have a CEC with latent CD. Etiology Etiology of CEC is unclear. It is not known if epilepsy and/or CC are a consequence of CD. CD is an immune auto-inflammatory reaction occurring in predisposed gluten-intolerant individuals. It originates from the jejunal mucosa and spreads to the lamina propria, leading to the observed histopathological features (crypt hyperplasia, jejunal villous atrophy and inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria). CD may induce autoimmune responses outside the gastrointestinal tract. Circulating activated T cells may cross the blood-brain barrier and be toxic to myelin or myelin-producing cells. As for isolated CD, CEC is associated with the HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 genes . Diagnostic methods Diagnosis relies on anamnestic investigation and EEG to characterize epileptic seizures. Computed tomography (CT) imaging reveals CC. Laboratory findings (antiendomisium antibodies , antigliadin antibodies, anti- tissue -transglutaminase type 2 antibodies, HLA phenotype ), and histopathological analysis of small bowel biopsy (jejunal mucosa villous atrophy) enable identification of silent or latent CD in a patient with epileptic seizures and CC. Differential diagnosis Differential diagnosis of CEC includes Sturge-Weber syndrome (see this term) without nevus flammeus and other conditions such as congenital folate malabsorption or adverse effects of methotrexate, antifolate agents and radiotherapy of leukemic children. Management and treatment CD requires life-long observance of a gluten-free diet (GFD), leading to clinical and histopathological resolution of symptoms. A study has revealed that early CD diagnosis and treatment by GFD could prevent or reverse the epileptic disorder. Prognosis Early diagnosis and good compliance of GFD greatly improve outcome. On the contrary, if treatment is delayed, epilepsy may be more severe and epileptic encephalopathy may develop. Visit the Orphanet disease page for more resources.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Epilepsy (Prognosis): While epilepsy cannot be cured, for some people the seizures can be controlled with medication, diet, devices, and/or surgery. Most seizures do not cause brain damage, but ongoing uncontrolled seizures may cause brain damage. It is not uncommon for people with epilepsy, especially children, to develop behavioral and emotional problems in conjunction with seizures. Issues may also arise as a result of the stigma attached to having epilepsy, which can led to embarrassment and frustration or bullying, teasing, or avoidance in school and other social settings. For many people with epilepsy, the risk of seizures restricts their independence (some states refuse drivers licenses to people with epilepsy) and recreational activities. Epilepsy can be a life-threatening condition. Some people with epilepsy are at special risk for abnormally prolonged seizures or sudden unexplained death in epilepsy.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerURL>https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093</AnswerURL>
				<AnswerText>Epilepsy (Symptoms): Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure signs and symptoms may include: - Temporary confusion - A staring spell - Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs - Loss of consciousness or awareness - Psychic symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode. Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how the abnormal brain activity begins. Focal seizures When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they&apos;re called focal (partial) seizures. These seizures fall into two categories: - Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don&apos;t cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. They may also result in involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. - Focal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. During a complex partial seizure, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders. Generalized seizures Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six types of generalized seizures exist. - Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief loss of awareness. - Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground. - Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenly collapse or fall down. - Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms. - Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs. - Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue. When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs: - The seizure lasts more than five minutes. - Breathing or consciousness doesn&apos;t return after the seizure stops. - A second seizure follows immediately. - You have a high fever. - You&apos;re experiencing heat exhaustion. - You&apos;re pregnant. - You have diabetes. - You&apos;ve injured yourself during the seizure. If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Epilepsy - children (Treatment): Treatment for epilepsy includes: - Medicines - Lifestyle changes - Surgery If your child&apos;s epilepsy is due to a tumor, abnormal blood vessels, or bleeding in the brain, surgery may be needed. Medicines to prevent seizures are called anticonvulsants or antiepileptic drugs. These may reduce the number of future seizures. - These medicines are taken by mouth. The type of medicine prescribed depends on the type of seizure your child has. - The dosage may need to be changed from time to time. The provider may order regular blood tests to check for side effects. - Always make sure your child takes the medicine on time and as directed. Missing a dose can cause your child to have a seizure. Do NOT stop or change medicines on your own. Talk to the provider first. Many epilepsy drugs may affect your child&apos;s bone health. Talk to your child&apos;s provider about whether your child needs vitamins and other supplements. Epilepsy that is not well controlled after trying a number of antiseizure drugs is called &quot;medically refractory epilepsy.&quot; In this case, the doctor may recommend surgery to: - Remove the abnormal brain cells causing the seizures. - Place a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS). This device is similar to a heart pacemaker. It can help reduce the number of seizures. Some children are placed on a special diet to help prevent seizures. The most popular one is the ketogenic diet. A diet low in carbohydrates, such as the Atkins diet, also may be helpful. Be sure to discuss these options with your child&apos;s provider before trying them. Epilepsy is often a lifelong or chronic illness. Important management issues include: - Taking medicines - Staying safe, such as never swimming alone, fall-proofing your home and so on  - Managing stress and sleep - Avoiding alcohol and drug abuse - Keeping up in school - Managing other illnesses Managing these lifestyle or medical issues at home can be a challenge.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerURL>https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093</AnswerURL>
				<AnswerText>Epilepsy (Treatment): Doctors generally begin by treating epilepsy with medication. If medications don&apos;t treat the condition, doctors may propose surgery or another type of treatment. Medication Most people with epilepsy can become seizure-free by taking one anti-seizure medication, which is also called anti-epileptic medication. Others may be able to decrease the frequency and intensity of their seizures by taking a combination of medications. Many children with epilepsy who aren&apos;t experiencing epilepsy symptoms can eventually discontinue medications and live a seizure-free life. Many adults can discontinue medications after two or more years without seizures. Your doctor will advise you about the appropriate time to stop taking medications. Finding the right medication and dosage can be complex. Your doctor will consider your condition, frequency of seizures, your age and other factors when choosing which medication to prescribe. Your doctor will also review any other medications you may be taking, to ensure the anti-epileptic medications won&apos;t interact with them. Your doctor likely will first prescribe a single medication at a relatively low dosage and may increase the dosage gradually until your seizures are well-controlled. Anti-seizure medications may have some side effects. Mild side effects include: - Fatigue - Dizziness - Weight gain - Loss of bone density - Skin rashes - Loss of coordination - Speech problems - Memory and thinking problems More-severe but rare side effects include: - Depression - Suicidal thoughts and behaviors - Severe rash - Inflammation of certain organs, such as your liver To achieve the best seizure control possible with medication, follow these steps: - Take medications exactly as prescribed. - Always call your doctor before switching to a generic version of your medication or taking other prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs or herbal remedies. - Never stop taking your medication without talking to your doctor. - Notify your doctor immediately if you notice new or increased feelings of depression, suicidal thoughts, or unusual changes in your mood or behaviors. - Tell your doctor if you have migraines. Doctors may prescribe one of the anti-epileptic medications that can prevent your migraines and treat epilepsy. At least half the people newly diagnosed with epilepsy will become seizure-free with their first medication. If anti-epileptic medications don&apos;t provide satisfactory results, your doctor may suggest surgery or other therapies. You&apos;ll have regular follow-up appointments with your doctor to evaluate your condition and medications. Surgery When medications fail to provide adequate control over seizures, surgery may be an option. With epilepsy surgery, a surgeon removes the area of your brain that&apos;s causing seizures. Doctors usually perform surgery when tests show that: - Your seizures originate in a small, well-defined area of your brain - The area in your brain to be operated on doesn&apos;t interfere with vital functions such as speech, language, motor function, vision or hearing Although many people continue to need some medication to help prevent seizures after successful surgery, you may be able to take fewer drugs and reduce your dosages. In a small number of cases, surgery for epilepsy can cause complications such as permanently altering your thinking (cognitive) abilities. Talk to your surgeon about his or her experience, success rates, and complication rates with the procedure you&apos;re considering. Therapies Apart from medications and surgery, these potential therapies offer an alternative for treating epilepsy: - Vagus nerve stimulation. In vagus nerve stimulation, doctors implant a device called a vagus nerve stimulator underneath the skin of your chest, similar to a heart pacemaker. Wires from the stimulator are connected to the vagus nerve in your neck. The battery-powered device sends bursts of electrical energy through the vagus nerve and to your brain. It&apos;s not clear how this inhibits seizures, but the device can usually reduce seizures by 20 to 40 percent. Most people still need to take anti-epileptic medication, although some people may be able to lower their medication dose. You may experience side effects from vagus nerve stimulation, such as throat pain, hoarse voice, shortness of breath or coughing. - Ketogenic diet. Some children with epilepsy have been able to reduce their seizures by following a strict diet that&apos;s high in fats and low in carbohydrates. In this diet, called a ketogenic diet, the body breaks down fats instead of carbohydrates for energy. After a few years, some children may be able to stop the ketogenic diet - under close supervision of their doctors - and remain seizure-free. Consult a doctor if you or your child is considering a ketogenic diet. It&apos;s important to make sure that your child doesn&apos;t become malnourished when following the diet. Side effects of a ketogenic diet may include dehydration, constipation, slowed growth because of nutritional deficiencies and a buildup of uric acid in the blood, which can cause kidney stones. These side effects are uncommon if the diet is properly and medically supervised. Following a ketogenic diet can be a challenge. Low-glycemic index and modified Atkins diets offer less restrictive alternatives that may still provide some benefit for seizure control. Potential future treatments Researchers are studying many potential new treatments for epilepsy, including: - Deep brain stimulation. In deep brain stimulation, surgeons implant electrodes into a specific part of your brain, typically your thalamus. The electrodes are connected to a generator implanted in your chest or the skull that sends electrical pulses to your brain and may reduce your seizures. - Responsive neurostimulation. Implantable, pacemaker-like devices that help prevent seizures are also under investigation. These responsive stimulation or closed loop devices analyze brain activity patterns to detect seizures before they happen and deliver an electrical charge or drug to stop the seizure. - Continuous stimulation of the seizure onset zone (subthreshold stimulation). Subthreshold stimulation - continuous stimulation to an area of your brain below a level that&apos;s physically noticeable - appears to improve seizure outcomes and quality of life for some people with seizures. This treatment approach may work in people who have seizures that start in an area of the brain that can&apos;t be removed because it would affect speech and motor functions (eloquent area). Or it might benefit people whose seizure characteristics mean their chances of successful treatment with responsive neurostimulation are low. - Minimally invasive surgery. New minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as MRI-guided laser ablation, show promise at reducing seizures with fewer risks than traditional open brain surgery for epilepsy. - Stereotactic laser ablation or radiosurgery. For some types of epilepsy, stereotactic laser ablation or stereotactic radiosurgery may provide effective treatment for people in which an open procedure may be too risky. In these procedures, doctors direct radiation at the specific area in the brain causing seizures, to destroy that tissue in an effort to better control the seizures. - External nerve stimulation device. Similar to vagus nerve stimulation, this device would stimulate specific nerves to reduce frequency of seizures. But unlike vagus nerve stimulation, this device would be worn externally so that no surgery to implant the device is needed.</AnswerText>

Some people with epilepsy simply stare blankly for a few seconds during a seizure, while others repeatedly twitch their arms or legs. Having a single seizure doesn&apos;t mean you have epilepsy. At least two unprovoked seizures are generally required for an epilepsy diagnosis. Treatment with medications or sometimes surgery can control seizures for the majority of people with epilepsy. Some people require lifelong treatment to control seizures, but for others, the seizures eventually go away. Some children with epilepsy may outgrow the condition with age.

				<AnswerText>Epilepsy (Summary): Summary Epilepsy is a brain disorder that causes people to have recurring seizures. The seizures happen when clusters of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain send out the wrong signals. People may have strange sensations and emotions or behave strangely. They may have violent muscle spasms or lose consciousness. Epilepsy has many possible causes, including illness, brain injury, and abnormal brain development. In many cases, the cause is unknown. Doctors use brain scans and other tests to diagnose epilepsy. It is important to start treatment right away. There is no cure for epilepsy, but medicines can control seizures for most people. When medicines are not working well, surgery or implanted devices such as vagus nerve stimulators may help. Special diets can help some children with epilepsy.

				<AnswerText>Epilepsy (Diagnosis): To diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your symptoms and medical history. Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose epilepsy and determine the cause of seizures. Your evaluation may include: - A neurological exam. Your doctor may test your behavior, motor abilities, mental function and other areas to diagnose your condition and determine the type of epilepsy you may have. - Blood tests. Your doctor may take a blood sample to check for signs of infections, genetic conditions or other conditions that may be associated with seizures. Your doctor may also suggest tests to detect brain abnormalities, such as: - Electroencephalogram (EEG). This is the most common test used to diagnose epilepsy. In this test, doctors attach electrodes to your scalp with a paste-like substance. The electrodes record the electrical activity of your brain. If you have epilepsy, it&apos;s common to have changes in your normal pattern of brain waves, even when you&apos;re not having a seizure. Your doctor may monitor you on video while conducting an EEG while you&apos;re awake or asleep, to record any seizures you experience. Recording the seizures may help the doctor determine what kind of seizures you&apos;re having or rule out other conditions. Your doctor may give you instructions to do something that will cause seizures, such as getting little sleep prior to the test. - High-density EEG. In a variation of an EEG test, your doctor may recommend high-density EEG, which spaces electrodes more closely than conventional EEG - about a half a centimeter apart. High-density EEG may help your doctor more precisely determine which areas of your brain are affected by seizures. - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of your brain. CT scans can reveal abnormalities in your brain that might be causing your seizures, such as tumors, bleeding and cysts. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a detailed view of your brain. Your doctor may be able to detect lesions or abnormalities in your brain that could be causing your seizures. - Functional MRI (fMRI). A functional MRI measures the changes in blood flow that occur when specific parts of your brain are working. Doctors may use an fMRI before surgery to identify the exact locations of critical functions, such as speech and movement, so that surgeons can avoid injuring those places while operating. - Positron emission tomography (PET). PET scans use a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that&apos;s injected into a vein to help visualize active areas of the brain and detect abnormalities. - Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). This type of test is used primarily if you&apos;ve had an MRI and EEG that didn&apos;t pinpoint the location in your brain where the seizures are originating. A SPECT test uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that&apos;s injected into a vein to create a detailed, 3-D map of the blood flow activity in your brain during seizures. Doctors also may conduct a form of a SPECT test called subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI (SISCOM), which may provide even more-detailed results. - Neuropsychological tests. In these tests, doctors assess your thinking, memory and speech skills. The test results help doctors determine which areas of your brain are affected. Along with your test results, your doctor may use a combination of analysis techniques to help pinpoint where in the brain seizures start: - Statistical parametric mapping (SPM). SPM is a method of comparing areas of the brain that have increased metabolism during seizures to normal brains, which can give doctors an idea of where seizures begin. - Curry analysis. Curry analysis is a technique that takes EEG data and projects it onto an MRI of the brain to show doctors where seizures are occurring. - Magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG measures the magnetic fields produced by brain activity to identify potential areas of seizure onset. Accurate diagnosis of your seizure type and where seizures begin gives you the best chance for finding an effective treatment.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What is Epilepsy?: The epilepsies are a spectrum of brain disorders ranging from severe, life-threatening and disabling, to ones that are much more benign. In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. The epilepsies have many possible causes and there are several types of seizures. Anything that disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activityfrom illness to brain damage to abnormal brain developmentcan lead to seizures. Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, changes in important features of brain cells called channels, or some combination of these and other factors. Having a single seizure as the result of a high fever (called febrile seizure) or head injury does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. Only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. A measurement of electrical activity in the brain and brain scans such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography are common diagnostic tests for epilepsy.</AnswerText>

The key to diagnosis is a detailed history from the affected person, as well as witnesses. Sometimes video- EEG monitoring is necessary. The features that are suggestive of a diagnosis of ADNFLE are: clusters of seizures with a frontal semiology seizures that occur predominantly during sleep normal clinical neurologic exam normal intellect (although reduced intellect, cognitive deficits, or psychiatric disorders may occur) normal findings on neuroimaging ictal EEG (recorded during a seizure) that may be normal or obscured by movement of the cables or electrodes interictal EEG (recorded in between seizures) that shows infrequent epileptiform discharges (distinctive patterns resembling those that occur in people with epilepsy) the presence of the same disorder in other family members, with evidence of autosomal dominant inheritance The diagnosis can be established in a person with the above features, combined with a positive family history and/or genetic testing that detects a mutation in one of the genes known to cause ADNFLE. People who are concerned they may be having seizures or other neurological signs or symptoms should be evaluated by a neurologist .</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Epilepsy - children: Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which a person has repeated seizures over time. A seizure is a sudden change in the electrical and chemical activity in the brain. A single seizure that does not happen again is NOT epilepsy. Epilepsy may be due to a medical condition or injury that affects the brain. Or the cause may be unknown. Common causes of epilepsy include: - Traumatic brain injury - Damage or scarring after infections of the brain - Birth defects that involve the brain - Brain injury that occurs during or near birth - Metabolic disorders present at birth (such as phenylketonuria) - Benign brain tumor, often very small - Abnormal blood vessels in the brain - Stroke - Other illnesses that damage or destroy brain tissue Epileptic seizures usually start between ages 5 and 20. But they can happen at any age. There may be a family history of seizures or epilepsy. A febrile seizure is a convulsion in a child triggered by a fever. Most of the time, a febrile seizure is not a sign that the child has epilepsy. Symptoms vary from child to child. Some children may simply stare. Others may shake violently and lose alertness. The movements or symptoms of a seizure may depend on the part of the brain that is affected. Your child&apos;s health care provider can tell you more about the specific type of seizure your child may have: - Absence (petit mal) seizure: Staring spells - Generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure: Involves the entire body, including aura, rigid muscles, and loss of alertness - Partial (focal) seizure: Can involve any of the symptoms described above, depending on where in the brain the seizure starts Most of the time, the seizure is similar to the one before it. Some children have a strange sensation before a seizure. Sensations may be tingling, smelling an odor that is not actually there, feeling fear or anxiety for no reason or having a sense of déjà vu (feeling that something has happened before). This is called an aura. The provider will: - Ask about your child&apos;s medical and family history in detail - Ask about the seizure episode - Do a physical exam of your child, including a detailed look at the brain and nervous system The provider will order an EEG (electroencephalogram) to check the electrical activity in the brain. This test often shows any abnormal electrical activity in the brain. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures. To diagnose epilepsy or plan for epilepsy surgery, your child may need to: - Wear an EEG recorder for few days during day-to-day activities - Stay in the hospital where brain activity can be watched on video cameras (video EEG) The provider also may order other tests, including: - Blood chemistry - Blood sugar - Complete blood count (CBC) - Kidney function tests - Liver function tests - Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) - Tests for infectious diseases Head CT or MRI scan are often done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. Much less often, PET scan of the brain is needed to help plan surgery. Treatment for epilepsy includes: - Medicines - Lifestyle changes - Surgery If your child&apos;s epilepsy is due to a tumor, abnormal blood vessels, or bleeding in the brain, surgery may be needed. Medicines to prevent seizures are called anticonvulsants or antiepileptic drugs. These may reduce the number of future seizures. - These medicines are taken by mouth. The type of medicine prescribed depends on the type of seizure your child has. - The dosage may need to be changed from time to time. The provider may order regular blood tests to check for side effects. - Always make sure your child takes the medicine on time and as directed. Missing a dose can cause your child to have a seizure. Do NOT stop or change medicines on your own. Talk to the provider first. Many epilepsy drugs may affect your child&apos;s bone health. Talk to your child&apos;s provider about whether your child needs vitamins and other supplements. Epilepsy that is not well controlled after trying a number of antiseizure drugs is called &quot;medically refractory epilepsy.&quot; In this case, the doctor may recommend surgery to: - Remove the abnormal brain cells causing the seizures. - Place a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS). This device is similar to a heart pacemaker. It can help reduce the number of seizures. Some children are placed on a special diet to help prevent seizures. The most popular one is the ketogenic diet. A diet low in carbohydrates, such as the Atkins diet, also may be helpful. Be sure to discuss these options with your child&apos;s provider before trying them. Epilepsy is often a lifelong or chronic illness. Important management issues include: - Taking medicines - Staying safe, such as never swimming alone, fall-proofing your home and so on  - Managing stress and sleep - Avoiding alcohol and drug abuse - Keeping up in school - Managing other illnesses Managing these lifestyle or medical issues at home can be a challenge. The stress of being a caretaker of a child with epilepsy can often be helped by joining a support group. In these groups, members share common experiences and problems. Most children with epilepsy live a normal life. Certain types of childhood epilepsy go away or improve with age, usually in the late teens or 20s. If your child does not have seizures for a few years, the provider may stop medicines. For many children, epilepsy is a lifelong condition. In these cases, the medicines need to be continued. Children who have developmental disorders that also cause epilepsy may face challenges throughout their life. Knowing more about the condition will help you take better care of your child&apos;s epilepsy. Complications may include: - Difficulty learning - Breathing in food or saliva into the lungs during a seizure, which can cause aspiration pneumonia - Irregular heartbeat - Injury from falls, bumps, or self-caused bites during a seizure - Permanent brain damage (stroke or other damage) - Side effects of medicines Call your local emergency number (such as 911) if: - This is the first time your child has a seizure - A seizure occurs in a child who is not wearing a medical ID bracelet (which has instructions explaining what to do) If your child has had seizures before, call 911 for any of these emergency situations: - The seizure is longer than the child normally has or the child has an unusual number of seizures - The child has repeated seizures over a few minutes - The child has repeated seizures in which consciousness or normal behavior is not regained between them (status epilepticus) - The child gets injured during the seizure - The child has difficulty breathing Call the provider if your child has new symptoms: - Nausea or vomiting - Rash - Side effects of medicines, such as drowsiness, restlessness, or confusion - Tremors or abnormal movements, or problems with coordination Contact the provider even if your child is normal after the seizure has stopped. There is no known way to prevent epilepsy. Proper diet and sleep may decrease the chances of seizures in children with epilepsy. Reduce the risk of head injury during risky activities. This can decrease the likelihood of a brain injury that leads to seizures and epilepsy. Updated by: Neil K.

				<AnswerText>Fanconi anemia: Fanconi anemia is a disease passed down through families (inherited) that mainly affects the bone marrow. It results in decreased production of all types of blood cells. Fanconi anemia is different from Fanconi syndrome, a rare kidney disorder. Fanconi anemia is due to an abnormal gene that damages cells, which keeps them from repairing damaged DNA. To inherit Fanconi anemia, a person must get 1 copy of the abnormal gene from each parent. The condition is most often diagnosed in children between 2 and 15 years old. People with Fanconi anemia have lower-than-normal numbers of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets (cells that help the blood clot). Not enough white blood cells can lead to infections. A lack of red blood cells may result in fatigue (anemia). A lower-than-normal amount of platelets may lead to excess bleeding. Most people with Fanconi anemia have some of these symptoms: - Abnormal heart, lungs, and digestive tract - Bone problems (especially the hips, spine or ribs, can cause a curved spine (scoliosis) - Changes in the color of the skin, such as darkened areas of the skin, called café au lait spots, and vitiligo - Deafness due to abnormal ears - Eye or eyelid problems - Kidney(s) that did not form correctly - Problems with the arms and hands, such as missing, extra or misshapen thumbs, problems of the hands and the bone in the lower arm, and small or missing bone in the forearm - Short height - Small head - Small testicles and genital changes Other possible symptoms: - Failure to thrive - Learning disability - Low birth weight - Intellectual disability Common tests for Fanconi anemia include: - Bone marrow biopsy - Complete blood count (CBC) - Developmental tests - Drugs added to a blood sample to check for damage to chromosomes - Hand x-ray and other imaging studies (CT scan, MRI) - Hearing test - HLA tissue typing (to find matching bone-marrow donors) - Ultrasound of the kidneys Pregnant women may have amniocentesis or chorionic villous sampling to diagnose the condition in their unborn child. People with mild to moderate blood cell changes who do not need a transfusion may only need regular check-ups and blood count checks. The health care provider will closely monitor the person for other cancers. These may include leukemia or cancers of the head, neck, or urinary system. Medicines called growth factors (such as erythropoietin, G-CSF, and GM-CSF) can improve blood counts for a short while. A bone marrow transplant can cure the blood count problems of Fanconi anemia. (The best bone marrow donor is a brother or sister whose tissue type matches the person affected by Fanconi anemia.) People who have had a successful bone marrow transplant still need regular check-ups because of the risk for additional cancers. Hormone therapy combined with low doses of steroids (such as hydrocortisone or prednisone) is prescribed to those who do not have a bone marrow donor. Most people respond to hormone therapy. But everyone with the disorder will quickly get worse when the drugs are stopped. In most cases, these drugs eventually stop working. Additional treatments may include: - Antibiotics (possibly given through a vein) to treat infections - Blood transfusions to treat symptoms due to low blood counts Most people with this condition visit a a doctor who is blood disorder specialist (hematologist), a doctor who treats diseases related to glands (endocrinologist), and an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) regularly. They also may see a bone doctor (orthopedist), gynecologist, or kidney disease specialist (nephrologist). The survival rates vary from person to person. The outlook is poor in those with low blood counts. New and improved treatments, such as bone marrow transplants, have likely improved survival. People with Fanconi anemia are more likely to develop several types of blood disorders and cancers. These may include leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and cancer of the head, neck, or urinary system. Women with Fanconi anemia who become pregnant should be watched carefully by a doctor. Such women often need transfusions throughout pregnancy. Men with Fanconi anemia have decreased fertility. Families with a history of this condition can have genetic counseling to better understand their risk. Vaccination can reduce certain complications, including pneumococcal pneumonia, hepatitis, and varicella infections. People with Fanconi anemia should avoid cancer-causing substances (carcinogens) and have regular check-ups to screen for cancer.

				<AnswerText>What is Anemia?: Espaol Anemia (uh-NEE-me-uh) is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. Anemia also can occur if your red blood cells don&apos;t contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. This protein helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. If you have anemia, your body doesn&apos;t get enough oxygen-rich blood. As a result, you may feel tired or weak. You also may have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or headaches. Severe or long-lasting anemia can damage your heart, brain, and other organs in your body. Very severe anemia may even cause death. Overview Blood is made up of many parts, including red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets (PLATE-lets), and plasma (the fluid portion of blood). Red blood cells are disc-shaped and look like doughnuts without holes in the center. They carry oxygen and remove carbon dioxide (a waste product) from your body. These cells are made in the bone marrowa sponge-like tissue inside the bones. White blood cells and platelets (PLATE-lets) also are made in the bone marrow. White blood cells help fight infection. Platelets stick together to seal small cuts or breaks on the blood vessel walls and stop bleeding. With some types of anemia, you may have low numbers of all three types of blood cells. Anemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, or high rates of red blood cell destruction. These causes might be the result of diseases, conditions, or other factors. Outlook Many types of anemia can be mild, short term, and easily treated. You can even prevent some types with a healthy diet. Other types can be treated with dietary supplements. However, certain types of anemia can be severe, long lasting, and even life threatening if not diagnosed and treated. If you have signs or symptoms of anemia, see your doctor to find out whether you have the condition. Treatment will depend on the cause of the anemia and how severe it is.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Anemia: Anemia is a condition in which you don&apos;t have enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to the body&apos;s tissues. Having anemia may make you feel tired and weak. There are many forms of anemia, each with its own cause. Anemia can be temporary or long term, and it can range from mild to severe. See your doctor if you suspect you have anemia because it can be a warning sign of serious illness. Treatments for anemia range from taking supplements to undergoing medical procedures. You may be able to prevent some types of anemia by eating a healthy, varied diet. Anemia care at Mayo Clinic Anemia signs and symptoms vary depending on the cause of your anemia. They may include: - Fatigue - Weakness - Pale or yellowish skin - Irregular heartbeats - Shortness of breath - Dizziness or lightheadedness - Chest pain - Cold hands and feet - Headache At first anemia can be so mild that it goes unnoticed. But symptoms worsen as anemia worsens. Make an appointment with your doctor if you&apos;re feeling fatigued for unexplained reasons. Some anemias, such as iron deficiency anemia or vitamin B-12 deficiency, are common. Fatigue has many causes besides anemia, so don&apos;t assume that if you&apos;re tired you must be anemic. Some people learn that their hemoglobin is low, which indicates anemia, when they go to donate blood. If you&apos;re told that you can&apos;t donate blood because of low hemoglobin, make an appointment with your doctor. Anemia occurs when your blood doesn&apos;t have enough red blood cells. This can happen if: - Your body doesn&apos;t make enough red blood cells - Bleeding causes you to lose red blood cells more quickly than they can be replaced - Your body destroys red blood cells Your body makes three types of blood cells - white blood cells to fight infection, platelets to help your blood clot and red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout your body. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin - an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. Hemoglobin enables red blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body and to carry carbon dioxide from other parts of the body to your lungs so that it can be exhaled. Most blood cells, including red blood cells, are produced regularly in your bone marrow - a spongy material found within the cavities of many of your large bones. To produce hemoglobin and red blood cells, your body needs iron, vitamin B-12, folate and other nutrients from the foods you eat. Different types of anemia and their causes include: - Iron deficiency anemia. This is the most common type of anemia worldwide. Iron deficiency anemia is caused by a shortage of iron in your body. Your bone marrow needs iron to make hemoglobin. Without adequate iron, your body can&apos;t produce enough hemoglobin for red blood cells. Without iron supplementation, this type of anemia occurs in many pregnant women. It is also caused by blood loss, such as from heavy menstrual bleeding, an ulcer, cancer and regular use of some over-the-counter pain relievers, especially aspirin. - Vitamin deficiency anemia. In addition to iron, your body needs folate and vitamin B-12 to produce enough healthy red blood cells. A diet lacking in these and other key nutrients can cause decreased red blood cell production. Additionally, some people may consume enough B-12, but their bodies aren&apos;t able to process the vitamin. This can lead to vitamin deficiency anemia, also known as pernicious anemia. - Anemia of chronic disease. Certain diseases - such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease, Crohn&apos;s disease and other chronic inflammatory diseases - can interfere with the production of red blood cells. - Aplastic anemia. This rare, life-threatening anemia occurs when your body doesn&apos;t produce enough red blood cells. Causes of aplastic anemia include infections, certain medicines, autoimmune diseases and exposure to toxic chemicals. - Anemias associated with bone marrow disease. A variety of diseases, such as leukemia and myelofibrosis, can cause anemia by affecting blood production in your bone marrow. The effects of these types of cancer and cancer-like disorders vary from mild to life-threatening. - Hemolytic anemias. This group of anemias develops when red blood cells are destroyed faster than bone marrow can replace them. Certain blood diseases increase red blood cell destruction. You can inherit a hemolytic anemia, or you can develop it later in life. - Sickle cell anemia. This inherited and sometimes serious condition is an inherited hemolytic anemia. It&apos;s caused by a defective form of hemoglobin that forces red blood cells to assume an abnormal crescent (sickle) shape. These irregular blood cells die prematurely, resulting in a chronic shortage of red blood cells. - Other anemias. There are several other forms of anemia, such as thalassemia and malarial anemia. These factors place you at increased risk of anemia: - A diet lacking in certain vitamins. Having a diet that is consistently low in iron, vitamin B-12 and folate increases your risk of anemia. - Intestinal disorders. Having an intestinal disorder that affects the absorption of nutrients in your small intestine - such as Crohn&apos;s disease and celiac disease - puts you at risk of anemia. - Menstruation. In general, women who haven&apos;t experienced menopause have a greater risk of iron deficiency anemia than do men and postmenopausal women. That&apos;s because menstruation causes the loss of red blood cells. - Pregnancy. If you&apos;re pregnant and aren&apos;t taking a multivitamin with folic acid, you&apos;re at an increased risk of anemia. - Chronic conditions. If you have cancer, kidney failure or another chronic condition, you may be at risk of anemia of chronic disease. These conditions can lead to a shortage of red blood cells. Slow, chronic blood loss from an ulcer or other source within your body can deplete your body&apos;s store of iron, leading to iron deficiency anemia. - Family history. If your family has a history of an inherited anemia, such as sickle cell anemia, you also may be at increased risk of the condition. - Other factors. A history of certain infections, blood diseases and autoimmune disorders, alcoholism, exposure to toxic chemicals, and the use of some medications can affect red blood cell production and lead to anemia. - Age. People over age 65 are at increased risk of anemia. Left untreated, anemia can cause many health problems, such as: - Severe fatigue. When anemia is severe enough, you may be so tired that you can&apos;t complete everyday tasks. - Pregnancy complications. Pregnant women with folate deficiency anemia may be more likely to experience complications, such as premature birth. - Heart problems. Anemia can lead to a rapid or irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). When you&apos;re anemic your heart must pump more blood to compensate for the lack of oxygen in the blood. This can lead to an enlarged heart or heart failure. - Death. Some inherited anemias, such as sickle cell anemia, can be serious and lead to life-threatening complications. Losing a lot of blood quickly results in acute, severe anemia and can be fatal. To diagnose anemia, your doctor may ask you about your medical and family history, perform a physical exam, and run the following tests: - Complete blood count (CBC). A CBC is used to count the number of blood cells in a sample of your blood. For anemia your doctor will be interested in the levels of the red blood cells contained in the blood (hematocrit) and the hemoglobin in your blood. Normal adult hematocrit values vary from one medical practice to another but are generally between 40 and 52 percent for men and 35 and 47 percent for women. Normal adult hemoglobin values are generally 14 to 18 grams per deciliter for men and 12 to 16 grams per deciliter for women. - A test to determine the size and shape of your red blood cells. Some of your red blood cells may also be examined for unusual size, shape and color. Additional diagnostic tests If you receive a diagnosis of anemia, your doctor may order additional tests to determine the underlying cause. For example, iron deficiency anemia can result from chronic bleeding of ulcers, benign polyps in the colon, colon cancer, tumors or kidney problems. Occasionally, it may be necessary to study a sample of your bone marrow to diagnose anemia. Anemia treatment depends on the cause. - Iron deficiency anemia. Treatment for this form of anemia usually involves taking iron supplements and making changes to your diet. If the underlying cause of iron deficiency is loss of blood - other than from menstruation - the source of the bleeding must be located and stopped. This may involve surgery. - Vitamin deficiency anemias. Treatment for folic acid and B-12 deficiency involves dietary supplements and increasing these nutrients in your diet. If your digestive system has trouble absorbing vitamin B-12 from the food you eat, you may need vitamin B-12 shots. At first, you may receive the shots every other day. Eventually, you&apos;ll need shots just once a month, which may continue for life, depending on your situation. - Anemia of chronic disease. There&apos;s no specific treatment for this type of anemia. Doctors focus on treating the underlying disease. If symptoms become severe, a blood transfusion or injections of synthetic erythropoietin, a hormone normally produced by your kidneys, may help stimulate red blood cell production and ease fatigue. - Aplastic anemia. Treatment for this anemia may include blood transfusions to boost levels of red blood cells. You may need a bone marrow transplant if your bone marrow is diseased and can&apos;t make healthy blood cells. - Anemias associated with bone marrow disease. Treatment of these various diseases can include medication, chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation. - Hemolytic anemias. Managing hemolytic anemias includes avoiding suspect medications, treating related infections and taking drugs that suppress your immune system, which may be attacking your red blood cells. Depending on the severity of your anemia, a blood transfusion or plasmapheresis may be necessary. Plasmapheresis is a type of blood-filtering procedure. In certain cases, removal of the spleen can be helpful. - Sickle cell anemia. Treatment for this anemia may include the administration of oxygen, pain-relieving drugs, and oral and intravenous fluids to reduce pain and prevent complications. Doctors also may recommend blood transfusions, folic acid supplements and antibiotics. A bone marrow transplant may be an effective treatment in some circumstances. A cancer drug called hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea) also is used to treat sickle cell anemia. - Thalassemia. This anemia may be treated with blood transfusions, folic acid supplements, medication, removal of the spleen (splenectomy), or a blood and bone marrow stem cell transplant.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What is Anemia?: If you have anemia, your blood does not carry enough oxygen to the rest of your body. The most common cause of anemia is not having enough iron. Your body needs iron to make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives the red color to blood. It carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Anemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, and high rates of red blood cell destruction. Conditions that may lead to anemia include - Heavy periods - Pregnancy - Ulcers - Colon polyps or colon cancer - Inherited disorders - A diet that does not have enough iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 - Blood disorders such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, or cancer - Aplastic anemia, a condition that can be inherited or acquired - G6PD deficiency, a metabolic disorder Anemia can make you feel tired, cold, dizzy, and irritable. You may be short of breath or have a headache. Your doctor will diagnose anemia with a physical exam and blood tests. Treatment depends on the kind of anemia you have.

				<AnswerText>Hemolytic anemia: Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. Normally, red blood cells last for about 120 days in the body. In hemolytic anemia, red blood cells in the blood are destroyed earlier than normal. The bone marrow is mostly responsible for making new red cells. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells. Hemolytic anemia occurs when the bone marrow isn&apos;t making enough red cells to replace the ones that are being destroyed. There are several possible causes of hemolytic anemia. Red blood cells may be destroyed due to: - An autoimmune problem in which the immune system mistakenly sees your own red blood cells as foreign substances and destroys them - Genetic defects within the red cells (such as sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, and G6PD deficiency) - Exposure to certain chemicals, drugs, and toxins - Infections - Blood clots in small blood vessels - Transfusion of blood from a donor with a blood type that does not match yours You may not have symptoms if the anemia is mild. If the problem develops slowly, the first symptoms may be: - Feeling weak or tired more often than usual, or with exercise - Headaches - Problems concentrating or thinking If the anemia gets worse, symptoms may include: - Lightheadedness when you stand up - Pale skin - Shortness of breath - Sore tongue - Enlarged spleen A test called a complete blood count (CBC) can help diagnose anemia and offer some hints to the type and cause of the problem. Important parts of the CBC include red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin, and hematocrit (HCT). These tests can identify the type of hemolytic anemia: - Absolute reticulocyte count - Coombs test, direct and indirect - Donath-Landsteiner test - Cold agglutinins - Free hemoglobin in the serum or urine - Hemosiderin in the urine - Platelet count - Protein electrophoresis - serum - Pyruvate kinase - Serum haptoglobin levels - Serum LDH Treatment depends on the type and cause of the hemolytic anemia: - In emergencies, a blood transfusion may be needed. - For an overactive immune system, drugs that suppress the immune system may be used. - When blood cells are being destroyed at a fast pace, the body may need extra folic acid and iron supplements to replace what is being lost. In rare cases, surgery is needed to take out the spleen. This is because the spleen acts as a filter that removes abnormal cells from the blood. Outcome depends on the type and cause of hemolytic anemia. Severe anemia can make heart disease, lung disease, or cerebrovascular disease worse. Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of hemolytic anemia. Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists and Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

				<AnswerURL>https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/5836/aplastic-anemia</AnswerURL>
				<AnswerText>Aplastic anemia: Aplastic anemia  is a blood disorder caused by failure of the bone marrow to make enough new blood cells . Bone marrow is a sponge-like tissue inside the bones that makes stem cells that develop into red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets . [1] Symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, shortness of breath, frequent infections, and bleeding. Aplastic anemia can lead to other health concerns such as an irregular heartbeat, an enlarged heart, and heart failure. It can be caused by injury to blood stem cells due to exposure to certain drugs, chemotherapy , congenital disorders, drug therapy to suppress the immune system , pregnancy, radiation therapy , or toxins such as benzene or arsenic. When the cause is unknown, it is referred to as idiopathic aplastic anemia. In about half of all cases, no cause can be found. The blood disorder can be acute or chronic. [2] Treatment may consist of supportive care only, blood transfusions, medicines to suppress the immune system, or hematopoietic cell transplantation. [3]  The British Committee for Standards in Haematology recommends treating infection or uncontrolled bleeding before administering immunosuppressive therapy, including in patients scheduled for HCT. [5] In the presence of severe infection, however, it may be necessary to proceed directly to HCT to provide the patient with the best chance for early neutrophil recovery. [5]  The Pediatric Haemato-Oncology Italian Association recommends HCT from a matched sibling donor for severe aplastic anemia, and if a matched donor is not available, options include immunosuppressive therapy or unrelated donor HCT. [6] Approximately one third of patients with aplastic anemia do not respond to immunosuppression. The thrombopoietin-receptor agonist eltrombopag is approved for use in patients with severe aplastic anemia who fail to respond adequately to immunosuppressive therapy. Independent of response or degree of response, risks include  relapse and late-onset clonal disease, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or leukemia. [14, 38, 39, 40, 41] Pregnant women with aplastic anemia have a 33% risk of relapse. [5] Provide supportive care in these patients, maintain the platelet count above 20 × 10 9/L, if possible, and consider administering cyclosporine. [5] Note that monotherapy with hematopoietic growth factors (eg, recombinant human erythropoietin [rHuEPO], granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) is not recommended for newly diagnosed patients. [5] Frequent outpatient follow-up for patients with aplastic anemia is needed to monitor blood counts and any adverse effects of various drugs. Transfusions of packed red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets are administered on an outpatient basis. The symptoms of aplastic anemia vary depending on how severe it is and how low blood counts are. Signs and symptoms may include: [2] [3] [4] Low numbers of red blood cells (anemia): May cause paleness (pallor), headache, palpitations, rapid heart rate Low numbers of platelets ( thrombocytopenia ): May result in gum bleeding, nosebleeds or bleeding in the internal organs and skin bruises. Low white blood cells (neutropenia): May present infections, recurrent infections, mouth sores.  The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Aplastic anemia - Bone marrow hypocellularity - Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging. Healthcare professionals typically look at a person’s medical history, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory test results in order to make a diagnosis. The following resources provide information relating to diagnosis and testing for this condition. If you have questions about getting a diagnosis, you should contact a healthcare professional. Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. Treatment for aplastic anemia varies depending on the severity. While some individuals with mild to moderate aplastic anemia may not require treatment, for others, treatment may include: [3] [5] Blood transfusions to keep blood cell counts at acceptable levels Blood and marrow stem cell transplants to replace damaged stem cells with health ones from a donor (another person) Medications to stimulate the bone marrow, suppress the immune system , and prevent and treat infections Blood and marrow stem cell transplants may cure aplastic anemia in some instances. This treatment option works best in children and young adults with severe aplastic anemia who are otherwise in good health. [5] For patients with severe aplastic anemia who are under the age of 20 years, and those ages 20 to 50 years who are otherwise in good health the first option is the transplant when a sibling donor is available. For those who do not have an available sibling donor, the medication eltrombopag or eltrombopag plus immunesuppression therapy can be used. For patients over 50 years of age, the decision is based on the patient’s overall health, and preferences, and treatment may include eltrombopag or eltrombopag plus immunesuppression therapy (horse anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclosporin A (CSA), and glucocorticoids). People older than 50 years old have more risks of having rejection with the transplant and have greater risks of treatment toxicity and early mortality. FDA-Approved Treatments The medication(s) listed below have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as orphan products for treatment of this condition. Learn more orphan products. National Library of Medicine Drug Information Portal Medline Plus Health Information A small number of people with aplastic anemia may spontaneously recover with supportive care; however, for most individuals, the condition worsens without identification and treatment of the underlying cause and/or treatment of the disease. Bone marrow transplant may cure the disease in children and young patients and has a 10 year survival rate of approximately 73%. For many, bone marrow transplant is not an option due to the risks and potential long-term side effects. [3] [4] [5]</AnswerText>

				<AnswerURL>https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/667/sideroblastic-anemia</AnswerURL>
				<AnswerText>Sideroblastic anemia: Sideroblastic anemia  is a group of blood disorders characterized by an impaired ability of the bone marrow to produce normal red blood cells . In this condition, the iron inside red blood cells is inadequately used to make hemoglobin, despite normal amounts of iron. As a result, iron accumulates in the red blood cells, giving a ringed appearance to the nucleus (ringed sideroblast). The signs and symptoms of this condition may include fatigue, breathing difficulties, weakness, and enlargement of the liver or spleen. There are many potential causes of sideroblastic anemia. [1] Depending on the cause, it can be classified as hereditary (sometimes called congenital ), acquired, and idiopathic (cause unknown). The treatment for this condition differs depending on the underlying cause. If acquired, avoidance and or removal of the toxin or drug can lead to recovery. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) may be useful in some circumstances. [1] [2] The signs and symptoms of sideroblastic anemia may include: fatigue, weakness, the sensation of a pounding or racing heart ( palpitations), shortness of breath, headaches, irritability, and chest pain. Physical findings may include pale skin and/or a lemon-yellow colored tinge to the skin and rarely, a brownish discoloration caused by bleeding under the skin. Enlargement of the spleen ( splenomegaly) and/or liver ( hepatomegaly) may also occur. Rarely, in severe cases, acute leukemia can develop. [1] Sideroblastic anemia can be caused by hereditary factors, acquired as part of an underlying condition or exposure to drugs or toxins , or the cause may be unknown (idiopathic). [1] Hereditary causes of sideroblastic anemia include: [2] [3] Mutations in the ALAS2, ABCB7, SCL19A2, GLRX5,  PSU1  Pearson syndrome Wolfram or DIDMOAD syndrome Mitochondrial SLC25A38 Erythropoietic protoporphyria Acquired causes of sideroblastic anemia include: [2] [3] Myelodysplastic syndrome SF3B1 - Splicing factor 3B subunit 1 mutations Nutritional deficiencies (copper, vitamin B6) Lead poisoning Zinc overdose Alcohol Drugs (anti-tuberculous agents, antibiotics , progesterone , chelators, busulfan) Hypothermia The diagnostic workup for sideroblastic anemia may include blood work ( complete blood count, peripheral smear, iron studies) and a bone marrow aspiration and/or  biopsy . Additional studies that may be useful include imaging of the brain, such as MRI and genetic testing for known or suspected hereditary conditions associated with sideroblastic anemia. [3] The treatment of sideroblastic anemia may differ depending on whether the underlying cause is inherited or acquired. For acquired cases, avoidance or removal of the toxin or causative medication may lead to recovery. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) therapy may be beneficial in both inherited and acquired forms. If vitamin B6 therapy is not effective, a blood transfusion can be useful, but since it has been known to worsen iron overload, the benefits and limitations of this option should be carefully considered. Rarely, when all other treatment methods have been exhausted, bone marrow transplantation may be utilized. While this therapy may offer the possibility of a cure, the complications associated with transplantation surgery must be considered. [2] [3] It is recommended that all individuals with sideroblastic anemia avoid zinc-containing supplements and the use of alcohol. Regular follow-up and care with a hematologist is important. [3] The prognosis of sideroblastic anemia varies depending on the underlying cause. For acquired cases, such as those associated with alcohol and drugs, there may not be long-term symptoms. Patients requiring transfusions, those with conditions unresponsive to pyridoxine and other therapies, and those with a myelodysplastic syndrome that develops into acute leukemia have a poorer prognosis. Major causes of death in cases of sideroblastic anemia are secondary hemochromatosis from transfusions and leukemia. Thrombocytosis appears to be a relatively good prognostic sign. Patients with no need for blood transfusions are very likely to be long-term survivors, whereas those who become transfusion dependent are at risk of death from the complications of secondary hemochromatosis.

				<AnswerText>Pernicious anemia: Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. There are many types of anemia. Pernicious anemia is a decrease in red blood cells that occurs when the intestines cannot properly absorb vitamin B12. Pernicious anemia is a type of vitamin B12 anemia. The body needs vitamin B12 to make red blood cells. You get this vitamin from eating foods such as meat, poultry, shellfish, eggs, and dairy products. A special protein, called intrinsic factor (IF), helps your intestines absorb vitamin B12. This protein is released by cells in the stomach. When the stomach does not make enough intrinsic factor, the intestine cannot properly absorb vitamin B12. Common causes of pernicious anemia include: - Weakened stomach lining (atrophic gastritis) - An autoimmune condition in which the body&apos;s immune system attacks the actual intrinsic factor protein or the cells in the lining of your stomach that make it. Very rarely, pernicious anemia is passed down through families. This is called congenital pernicious anemia. Babies with this type of anemia do not make enough intrinsic factor. Or they cannot properly absorb vitamin B12 in the small intestine. In adults, symptoms of pernicious anemia are usually not seen until after age 30. The average age of diagnosis is age 60. You are more likely to develop this disease if you: - Are Scandinavian or Northern European - Have a family history of the condition Certain diseases can also raise your risk. They include: - Addison disease - Chronic thyroiditis - Graves disease - Hypoparathyroidism - Hypopituitarism - Myasthenia gravis - Secondary amenorrhea - Type 1 diabetes - Testicular dysfunction - Vitiligo Some people do not have symptoms. Symptoms may be mild. They can include: - Desire to eat ice or other non-food things (pica) - Diarrhea or constipation - Fatigue, lack of energy, or lightheadedness when standing up or with exertion - Loss of appetite - Pale skin - Problems concentrating - Shortness of breath, mostly during exercise - Swollen, red tongue or bleeding gums If you have a low vitamin B12 level for a long time, you can have nervous system damage. Symptoms can include: - Confusion - Depression - Loss of balance - Numbness and tingling in the hands and feet The health care provider will perform a physical exam. Tests that may be done include: - Bone marrow examination (only needed if diagnosis is unclear) - Complete blood count (CBC) - Reticulocyte count - Schilling test - LDH level - Methylmalonic acid (MMA) level - Vitamin B12 level - Levels of antibodies against IF or the cells which make IF The goal of treatment is to increase your vitamin B12 level: - Treatment involves a shot of vitamin B12 once a month. People with severely low levels of B12 may need more shots in the beginning. - Some people may also need to take vitamin B12 supplements by mouth. - A certain type of vitamin B12 may be given through the nose. Your provider will also recommend eating a variety of foods. Most people often do well with treatment. It is important to start treatment early. Nerve damage can be permanent if treatment does not start within 6 months of symptoms. People with pernicious anemia may have gastric polyps. They are also more likely to develop gastric cancer and gastric carcinoid tumors. Brain and nervous system problems may continue or be permanent if treatment is delayed. A woman with a low B12 level may have a false positive Pap smear. This is because vitamin B12 deficiency affects the way certain cells (epithelial cells) in the cervix look. Call your provider if you have symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency. There is no known way to prevent this type of vitamin B12 anemia. However, early detection and treatment can help reduce complications. Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists and Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

				<AnswerText>Aplastic anemia: Aplastic anemia is a condition that occurs when your body stops producing enough new blood cells. Aplastic anemia leaves you feeling fatigued and with a higher risk of infections and uncontrolled bleeding. A rare and serious condition, aplastic anemia can develop at any age. Aplastic anemia may occur suddenly, or it can occur slowly and get worse over a long period of time. Treatment for aplastic anemia may include medications, blood transfusions or a stem cell transplant, also known as a bone marrow transplant. Aplastic anemia symptoms may include: - Fatigue - Shortness of breath with exertion - Rapid or irregular heart rate - Pale skin - Frequent or prolonged infections - Unexplained or easy bruising - Nosebleeds and bleeding gums - Prolonged bleeding from cuts - Skin rash - Dizziness - Headache Aplastic anemia can progress slowly over weeks or months, or it may come on suddenly. The illness may be brief, or it may become chronic. Aplastic anemia can be very severe and even fatal. Aplastic anemia develops when damage occurs to your bone marrow, slowing or shutting down the production of new blood cells. Bone marrow is a red, spongy material inside your bones that produces stem cells, which give rise to other cells. Stem cells in the bone marrow produce blood cells - red cells, white cells and platelets. In aplastic anemia, the bone marrow is described in medical terms as aplastic or hypoplastic - meaning that it&apos;s empty (aplastic) or contains very few blood cells (hypoplastic). Factors that can temporarily or permanently injure bone marrow and affect blood cell production include: - Radiation and chemotherapy treatments. While these cancer-fighting therapies kill cancer cells, they can also damage healthy cells, including stem cells in bone marrow. Aplastic anemia can be a temporary side effect of these treatments. - Exposure to toxic chemicals. Exposure to toxic chemicals, such as some used in pesticides and insecticides, may cause aplastic anemia. Exposure to benzene - an ingredient in gasoline - also has been linked to aplastic anemia. This type of anemia may get better on its own if you avoid repeated exposure to the chemicals that caused your initial illness. - Use of certain drugs. Some medications, such as those used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and some antibiotics, can cause aplastic anemia. - Autoimmune disorders. An autoimmune disorder, in which your immune system begins attacking healthy cells, may involve stem cells in your bone marrow. - A viral infection. Viral infections that affect bone marrow may play a role in the development of aplastic anemia in some people. Viruses that have been linked to the development of aplastic anemia include hepatitis, Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19 and HIV. - Pregnancy. Aplastic anemia that occurs in pregnancy may be related to an autoimmune problem - your immune system may attack your bone marrow during pregnancy. - Unknown factors. In many cases, doctors aren&apos;t able to identify the cause of aplastic anemia. This is called idiopathic aplastic anemia. Aplastic anemia can be mistaken for a condition called myelodysplastic syndrome. In this group of disorders, the bone marrow produces new blood cells, but they&apos;re deformed and underdeveloped. The bone marrow in myelodysplastic syndrome is sometimes called hyperplastic - meaning that it&apos;s packed with blood cells. But some people with myelodysplastic syndrome have empty marrow that&apos;s difficult to distinguish from aplastic anemia. Some people with aplastic anemia also have a rare disorder known as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. This disorder causes red blood cells to break down too soon. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria can lead to aplastic anemia, or aplastic anemia can evolve into paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Fanconi&apos;s anemia is a rare, inherited disease that leads to aplastic anemia. Children born with it tend to be smaller than average and have birth defects, such as underdeveloped limbs. The disease is diagnosed with the help of blood tests. Aplastic anemia is rare. Factors that may increase your risk include: - Treatment with high-dose radiation or chemotherapy for cancer - Exposure to toxic chemicals - The use of some prescription drugs - such as chloramphenicol, which is used to treat bacterial infections, and gold compounds used to treat rheumatoid arthritis - Certain blood diseases, autoimmune disorders and serious infections - Pregnancy, rarely To diagnose aplastic anemia, your doctor may recommend: - Blood tests. Normally, red blood cell, white blood cell and platelet levels stay within a certain range. Your doctor may suspect aplastic anemia when all three of these blood cell levels are very low. - Bone marrow biopsy. To confirm a diagnosis, you&apos;ll need to undergo a bone marrow biopsy. In this procedure, a doctor uses a needle to remove a small sample of bone marrow from a large bone in your body, such as your hipbone. The bone marrow sample is examined under a microscope to rule out other blood-related diseases. In aplastic anemia, bone marrow contains fewer blood cells than normal. Once you&apos;ve received a diagnosis of aplastic anemia, you may need additional tests to determine an underlying cause. Treatments for aplastic anemia may include observation for mild cases, blood transfusions and medications for more-serious cases, and in severe cases, bone marrow transplantation. Severe aplastic anemia, in which your blood cell counts are extremely low, is life-threatening and requires immediate hospitalization for treatment. Blood transfusions Treatment for aplastic anemia usually involves blood transfusions to control bleeding and relieve anemia symptoms. Blood transfusions aren&apos;t a cure for aplastic anemia. But they do relieve signs and symptoms by providing blood cells that your bone marrow isn&apos;t producing. A transfusion may include: - Red blood cells. Transfusions of red blood cells raise red blood cell counts. This helps relieve anemia and fatigue. - Platelets. Transfusions of platelets help prevent excessive bleeding. While there&apos;s generally no limit to the number of blood cell transfusions you can have, complications can sometimes arise with multiple transfusions. Transfused red blood cells contain iron that can accumulate in your body and can damage vital organs if an iron overload isn&apos;t treated. Medications can help your body get rid of excess iron. Over time, your body may develop antibodies to transfused blood cells, making them less effective at relieving symptoms. The use of immunosuppressant medication makes this complication less likely. Stem cell transplant A stem cell transplant to rebuild the bone marrow with stem cells from a donor may offer the only successful treatment option for people with severe aplastic anemia. A stem cell transplant, which is also called a bone marrow transplant, is generally the treatment of choice for people who are younger and have a matching donor - most often a sibling. If a donor is found, your diseased bone marrow is first depleted with radiation or chemotherapy. Healthy stem cells from the donor are filtered from the blood. The healthy stem cells are injected intravenously into your bloodstream, where they migrate to the bone marrow cavities and begin generating new blood cells. The procedure requires a lengthy hospital stay. After the transplant, you&apos;ll receive drugs to help prevent rejection of the donated stem cells. A stem cell transplant carries risks. There&apos;s a chance that your body may reject the transplant, leading to life-threatening complications. In addition, not everyone is a candidate for transplantation or can find a suitable donor. Immunosuppressants For people who can&apos;t undergo a bone marrow transplant or for those whose aplastic anemia may be due to an autoimmune disorder, treatment may involve drugs that alter or suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants). Drugs such as cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune) and anti-thymocyte globulin are examples. These drugs suppress the activity of immune cells that are damaging your bone marrow. This helps your bone marrow recover and generate new blood cells. Cyclosporine and anti-thymocyte globulin are often used in combination. Corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone (Medrol, Solu-Medrol), are often given at the same time as these drugs. Immune-suppressing drugs can be very effective at treating aplastic anemia. The downside is that these drugs further weaken your immune system. It&apos;s also possible that after you stop taking these drugs, aplastic anemia may return. Bone marrow stimulants Certain drugs - including colony-stimulating factors, such as sargramostim (Leukine), filgrastim (Neupogen) and pegfilgrastim (Neulasta), and epoetin alfa (Epogen, Procrit) - may help stimulate the bone marrow to produce new blood cells. Growth factors are often used in combination with immune-suppressing drugs. Antibiotics, antivirals Having aplastic anemia weakens your immune system. You have fewer white blood cells in circulation to fight off germs. This leaves you susceptible to infections. At the first sign of infection, such as a fever, see your doctor. You don&apos;t want the infection to get worse, because it could prove life-threatening. If you have severe aplastic anemia, your doctor may give you antibiotics or antiviral medications to help prevent infections. Other treatments Aplastic anemia caused by radiation and chemotherapy treatments for cancer usually improves once you complete those treatments. The same is true for most other drugs that induce aplastic anemia. Pregnant women with aplastic anemia are treated with blood transfusions. For many women, pregnancy-related aplastic anemia improves once the pregnancy ends. If that doesn&apos;t happen, treatment is still necessary. If you have aplastic anemia, take care of yourself by: - Resting when you need to. Anemia can cause fatigue and shortness of breath with even mild exertion. Take a break and rest when you need to. - Avoiding contact sports. Because of the risk of bleeding associated with a low platelet count, avoid activities that may result in a cut or fall. - Protecting yourself from germs. You can reduce your risk of infections with frequent hand-washing and by avoiding sick people. If you develop a fever or other indicators of an infection, see your doctor for treatment.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What causes Anemia?: The three main causes of anemia are: Blood loss Lack of red blood cell production High rates of red blood cell destruction For some people, the condition is caused by more than one of these factors. Blood Loss Blood loss is the most common cause of anemia, especially iron-deficiency anemia. Blood loss can be short term or persist over time. Heavy menstrual periods or bleeding in the digestive or urinary tract can cause blood loss. Surgery, trauma, or cancer also can cause blood loss. If a lot of blood is lost, the body may lose enough red blood cells to cause anemia. Lack of Red Blood Cell Production Both acquired and inherited conditions and factors can prevent your body from making enough red blood cells. &quot;Acquired&quot; means you aren&apos;t born with the condition, but you develop it. &quot;Inherited&quot; means your parents passed the gene for the condition on to you. Acquired conditions and factors that can lead to anemia include poor diet, abnormal hormone levels, some chronic (ongoing) diseases, and pregnancy. Aplastic anemia also can prevent your body from making enough red blood cells. This condition can be acquired or inherited. Diet A diet that lacks iron, folic acid (folate), or vitamin B12 can prevent your body from making enough red blood cells. Your body also needs small amounts of vitamin C, riboflavin, and copper to make red blood cells. Conditions that make it hard for your body to absorb nutrients also can prevent your body from making enough red blood cells. Hormones Your body needs the hormone erythropoietin (eh-rith-ro-POY-eh-tin) to make red blood cells. This hormone stimulates the bone marrow to make these cells. A low level of this hormone can lead to anemia. Diseases and Disease Treatments Chronic diseases, like kidney disease and cancer, can make it hard for your body to make enough red blood cells. Some cancer treatments may damage the bone marrow or damage the red blood cells&apos; ability to carry oxygen. If the bone marrow is damaged, it can&apos;t make red blood cells fast enough to replace the ones that die or are destroyed. People who have HIV/AIDS may develop anemia due to infections or medicines used to treat their diseases. Pregnancy Anemia can occur during pregnancy due to low levels of iron and folic acid and changes in the blood. During the first 6 months of pregnancy, the fluid portion of a woman&apos;s blood (the plasma) increases faster than the number of red blood cells. This dilutes the blood and can lead to anemia. Aplastic Anemia Some infants are born without the ability to make enough red blood cells. This condition is called aplastic anemia. Infants and children who have aplastic anemia often need blood transfusions to increase the number of red blood cells in their blood. Acquired conditions or factors, such as certain medicines, toxins, and infectious diseases, also can cause aplastic anemia. High Rates of Red Blood Cell Destruction Both acquired and inherited conditions and factors can cause your body to destroy too many red blood cells. One example of an acquired condition is an enlarged or diseased spleen. The spleen is an organ that removes wornout red blood cells from the body. If the spleen is enlarged or diseased, it may remove more red blood cells than normal, causing anemia. Examples of inherited conditions that can cause your body to destroy too many red blood cells include sickle cell anemia, thalassemias, and lack of certain enzymes. These conditions create defects in the red blood cells that cause them to die faster than healthy red blood cells. Hemolytic anemia is another example of a condition in which your body destroys too many red blood cells. Inherited or acquired conditions or factors can cause hemolytic anemia. Examples include immune disorders, infections, certain medicines, or reactions to blood transfusions.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What causes Anemia?: Although many parts of the body help make red blood cells, most of the work is done in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells. Healthy red blood cells last between 90 and 120 days. Parts of your body then remove old blood cells. A hormone called erythropoietin (epo) made in your kidneys signals your bone marrow to make more red blood cells. Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying protein inside red blood cells. It gives red blood cells their color. People with anemia do not have enough hemoglobin. The body needs certain vitamins, minerals, and nutrients to make enough red blood cells. Iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid are three of the most important ones. The body may not have enough of these nutrients due to: - Changes in the lining of the stomach or intestines affect how well nutrients are absorbed (for example, celiac disease) - Poor diet - Slow blood loss (for example, from heavy menstrual periods or stomach ulcers) - Surgery that removes part of the stomach or intestines Possible causes of anemia include: - Certain medicines - Destruction of red blood cells earlier than normal (which may be caused by immune system problems) - Long-term (chronic) diseases such as chronic kidney disease, cancer, ulcerative colitis, or rheumatoid arthritis - Some forms of anemia, such as thalassemia or sickle cell anemia, which can be inherited - Pregnancy - Problems with bone marrow such as lymphoma, leukemia, myelodysplasia, multiple myeloma, or aplastic anemia</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Aplastic anemia (Summary): Aplastic anemia  is a blood disorder caused by failure of the bone marrow to make enough new blood cells . Bone marrow is a sponge-like tissue inside the bones that makes stem cells that develop into red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets . [1] Symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, shortness of breath, frequent infections, and bleeding. Aplastic anemia can lead to other health concerns such as an irregular heartbeat, an enlarged heart, and heart failure. It can be caused by injury to blood stem cells due to exposure to certain drugs, chemotherapy , congenital disorders, drug therapy to suppress the immune system , pregnancy, radiation therapy , or toxins such as benzene or arsenic. When the cause is unknown, it is referred to as idiopathic aplastic anemia. In about half of all cases, no cause can be found. The blood disorder can be acute or chronic. [2] Treatment may consist of supportive care only, blood transfusions, medicines to suppress the immune system, or hematopoietic cell transplantation. [3]  The British Committee for Standards in Haematology recommends treating infection or uncontrolled bleeding before administering immunosuppressive therapy, including in patients scheduled for HCT. [5] In the presence of severe infection, however, it may be necessary to proceed directly to HCT to provide the patient with the best chance for early neutrophil recovery. [5]  The Pediatric Haemato-Oncology Italian Association recommends HCT from a matched sibling donor for severe aplastic anemia, and if a matched donor is not available, options include immunosuppressive therapy or unrelated donor HCT. [6] Approximately one third of patients with aplastic anemia do not respond to immunosuppression. The thrombopoietin-receptor agonist eltrombopag is approved for use in patients with severe aplastic anemia who fail to respond adequately to immunosuppressive therapy. Independent of response or degree of response, risks include  relapse and late-onset clonal disease, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or leukemia. [14, 38, 39, 40, 41] Pregnant women with aplastic anemia have a 33% risk of relapse. [5] Provide supportive care in these patients, maintain the platelet count above 20 × 10 9/L, if possible, and consider administering cyclosporine. [5] Note that monotherapy with hematopoietic growth factors (eg, recombinant human erythropoietin [rHuEPO], granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) is not recommended for newly diagnosed patients. [5] Frequent outpatient follow-up for patients with aplastic anemia is needed to monitor blood counts and any adverse effects of various drugs. Transfusions of packed red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets are administered on an outpatient basis.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Aplastic anemia (Treatment): Treatment for aplastic anemia varies depending on the severity. While some individuals with mild to moderate aplastic anemia may not require treatment, for others, treatment may include: [3] [5] Blood transfusions to keep blood cell counts at acceptable levels Blood and marrow stem cell transplants to replace damaged stem cells with health ones from a donor (another person) Medications to stimulate the bone marrow, suppress the immune system , and prevent and treat infections Blood and marrow stem cell transplants may cure aplastic anemia in some instances. This treatment option works best in children and young adults with severe aplastic anemia who are otherwise in good health. [5] For patients with severe aplastic anemia who are under the age of 20 years, and those ages 20 to 50 years who are otherwise in good health the first option is the transplant when a sibling donor is available. For those who do not have an available sibling donor, the medication eltrombopag or eltrombopag plus immunesuppression therapy can be used. For patients over 50 years of age, the decision is based on the patient’s overall health, and preferences, and treatment may include eltrombopag or eltrombopag plus immunesuppression therapy (horse anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclosporin A (CSA), and glucocorticoids). People older than 50 years old have more risks of having rejection with the transplant and have greater risks of treatment toxicity and early mortality.

Other signs and symptoms of anemia include: Shortness of breath Dizziness Headache Coldness in the hands and feet Pale skin Chest pain These signs and symptoms can occur because your heart has to work harder to pump oxygen-rich blood through your body. Mild to moderate anemia may cause very mild symptoms or none at all. Complications of Anemia Some people who have anemia may have arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs). Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. Over time, arrhythmias can damage your heart and possibly lead to heart failure. Anemia also can damage other organs in your body because your blood can&apos;t get enough oxygen to them. Anemia can weaken people who have cancer or HIV/AIDS. This can make their treatments not work as well. Anemia also can cause many other health problems. People who have kidney disease and anemia are more likely to have heart problems. With some types of anemia, too little fluid intake or too much loss of fluid in the blood and body can occur. Severe loss of fluid can be life threatening.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Aplastic Anemia (SIGNS and SYMPTOMS): Lower than normal numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets cause most of the signs and symptoms of aplastic anemia. Signs and Symptoms of Low Blood Cell Counts   Red Blood Cells The most common symptom of a low red blood cell count is fatigue (tiredness). A lack of hemoglobin in the blood causes fatigue. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells. It helps carry oxygen to the body. A low red blood cell count also can cause shortness of breath; dizziness, especially when standing up; headaches; coldness in your hands or feet; pale skin; and chest pain. If you don&apos;t have enough hemoglobin-carrying red blood cells, your heart has to work harder to move the reduced amount of oxygen in your blood. This can lead to arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), a heart murmur, an enlarged heart, or even heart failure. White Blood Cells White blood cells help fight infections. Signs and symptoms of a low white blood cell count include fevers, frequent infections that can be severe, and flu-like illnesses that linger. Platelets Platelets stick together to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding. People who have low platelet counts tend to bruise and bleed easily, and the bleeding may be hard to stop. Common types of bleeding associated with a low platelet count include nosebleeds, bleeding gums, pinpoint red spots on the skin, and blood in the stool. Women also may have heavy menstrual bleeding. Other Signs and Symptoms Aplastic anemia can cause signs and symptoms that aren&apos;t directly related to low blood cell counts. Examples include nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and skin rashes. Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria Some people who have aplastic anemia have a condition called paroxysmal (par-ok-SIZ-mal) nocturnal hemoglobinuria (HE-mo-glo-bi-NOO-re-ah), or PNH. This is a red blood cell disorder. Most people who have PNH don&apos;t have any signs or symptoms. If symptoms do occur, they may include: Shortness of breath Swelling or pain in the abdomen or swelling in the legs caused by blood clots Blood in the urine Headaches Jaundice (a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes) In people who have aplastic anemia and PNH, either condition can develop first.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What are the treatments for Anemia?: Treatment for anemia depends on the type, cause, and severity of the condition. Treatments may include dietary changes or supplements, medicines, procedures, or surgery to treat blood loss. Goals of Treatment The goal of treatment is to increase the amount of oxygen that your blood can carry. This is done by raising the red blood cell count and/or hemoglobin level. (Hemoglobin is the iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body.) Another goal is to treat the underlying cause of the anemia. Dietary Changes and Supplements Low levels of vitamins or iron in the body can cause some types of anemia. These low levels might be the result of a poor diet or certain diseases or conditions. To raise your vitamin or iron level, your doctor may ask you to change your diet or take vitamin or iron supplements. Common vitamin supplements are vitamin B12 and folic acid (folate). Vitamin C sometimes is given to help the body absorb iron. Iron Your body needs iron to make hemoglobin. Your body can more easily absorb iron from meats than from vegetables or other foods. To treat your anemia, your doctor may suggest eating more meatespecially red meat (such as beef or liver), as well as chicken, turkey, pork, fish, and shellfish. Nonmeat foods that are good sources of iron include: Spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables Tofu Peas; lentils; white, red, and baked beans; soybeans; and chickpeas Dried fruits, such as prunes, raisins, and apricots Prune juice Iron-fortified cereals and breads You can look at the Nutrition Facts label on packaged foods to find out how much iron the items contain. The amount is given as a percentage of the total amount of iron you need every day. Iron also is available as a supplement. It&apos;s usually combined with multivitamins and other minerals that help your body absorb iron. Doctors may recommend iron supplements for premature infants, infants and young children who drink a lot of cow&apos;s milk, and infants who are fed breast milk only or formula that isn&apos;t fortified with iron. Large amounts of iron can be harmful, so take iron supplements only as your doctor prescribes. Vitamin B12 Low levels of vitamin B12 can lead to pernicious anemia. This type of anemia often is treated with vitamin B12 supplements. Good food sources of vitamin B12 include: Breakfast cereals with added vitamin B12 Meats such as beef, liver, poultry, and fish Eggs and dairy products (such as milk, yogurt, and cheese) Foods fortified with vitamin B12, such as soy-based beverages and vegetarian burgers Folic Acid Folic acid (folate) is a form of vitamin B that&apos;s found in foods. Your body needs folic acid to make and maintain new cells. Folic acid also is very important for pregnant women. It helps them avoid anemia and promotes healthy growth of the fetus. Good sources of folic acid include: Bread, pasta, and rice with added folic acid Spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables Black-eyed peas and dried beans Beef liver Eggs Bananas, oranges, orange juice, and some other fruits and juices Vitamin C Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron. Good sources of vitamin C are vegetables and fruits, especially citrus fruits. Citrus fruits include oranges, grapefruits, tangerines, and similar fruits. Fresh and frozen fruits, vegetables, and juices usually have more vitaminC than canned ones. If you&apos;re taking medicines, ask your doctor or pharmacist whether you can eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice. This fruit can affect the strength of a few medicines and how well they work. Other fruits rich in vitamin C include kiwi fruit, strawberries, and cantaloupes. Vegetables rich in vitamin C include broccoli, peppers, Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, cabbage, potatoes, and leafy green vegetables like turnip greens and spinach. Medicines Your doctor may prescribe medicines to help your body make more red blood cells or to treat an underlying cause of anemia. Some of these medicines include: Antibiotics to treat infections. Hormones to treat heavy menstrual bleeding in teenaged and adult women. A man-made version of erythropoietin to stimulate your body to make more red blood cells. This hormone has some risks. You and your doctor will decide whether the benefits of this treatment outweigh the risks. Medicines to prevent the body&apos;s immune system from destroying its own red blood cells. Chelation (ke-LAY-shun) therapy for lead poisoning. Chelation therapy is used mainly in children. This is because children who have iron-deficiency anemia are at increased risk of lead poisoning. Procedures If your anemia is severe, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure. Procedures include blood transfusions and blood and marrow stem cell transplants. Blood Transfusion A blood transfusion is a safe, common procedure in which blood is given to you through an intravenous (IV) line in one of your blood vessels. Transfusions require careful matching of donated blood with the recipient&apos;s blood. For more information, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article. Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant A blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces your faulty stem cells with healthy ones from another person (a donor). Stem cells are made in the bone marrow. They develop into red and white blood cells and platelets. During the transplant, which is like a blood transfusion, you get donated stem cells through a tube placed in a vein in your chest. Once the stem cells are in your body, they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells. For more information, go to the Health Topics Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant article. Surgery If you have serious or life-threatening bleeding that&apos;s causing anemia, you may need surgery. For example, you may need surgery to control ongoing bleeding due to a stomach ulcer or colon cancer. If your body is destroying red blood cells at a high rate, you may need to have your spleen removed. The spleen is an organ that removes wornout red blood cells from the body. An enlarged or diseased spleen may remove more red blood cells than normal, causing anemia.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Aplastic anemia (Treatment): Treatments for aplastic anemia may include observation for mild cases, blood transfusions and medications for more-serious cases, and in severe cases, bone marrow transplantation. Severe aplastic anemia, in which your blood cell counts are extremely low, is life-threatening and requires immediate hospitalization for treatment. Blood transfusions Treatment for aplastic anemia usually involves blood transfusions to control bleeding and relieve anemia symptoms. Blood transfusions aren&apos;t a cure for aplastic anemia. But they do relieve signs and symptoms by providing blood cells that your bone marrow isn&apos;t producing. A transfusion may include: - Red blood cells. Transfusions of red blood cells raise red blood cell counts. This helps relieve anemia and fatigue. - Platelets. Transfusions of platelets help prevent excessive bleeding. While there&apos;s generally no limit to the number of blood cell transfusions you can have, complications can sometimes arise with multiple transfusions. Transfused red blood cells contain iron that can accumulate in your body and can damage vital organs if an iron overload isn&apos;t treated. Medications can help your body get rid of excess iron. Over time, your body may develop antibodies to transfused blood cells, making them less effective at relieving symptoms. The use of immunosuppressant medication makes this complication less likely. Stem cell transplant A stem cell transplant to rebuild the bone marrow with stem cells from a donor may offer the only successful treatment option for people with severe aplastic anemia. A stem cell transplant, which is also called a bone marrow transplant, is generally the treatment of choice for people who are younger and have a matching donor - most often a sibling. If a donor is found, your diseased bone marrow is first depleted with radiation or chemotherapy. Healthy stem cells from the donor are filtered from the blood. The healthy stem cells are injected intravenously into your bloodstream, where they migrate to the bone marrow cavities and begin generating new blood cells. The procedure requires a lengthy hospital stay. After the transplant, you&apos;ll receive drugs to help prevent rejection of the donated stem cells. A stem cell transplant carries risks. There&apos;s a chance that your body may reject the transplant, leading to life-threatening complications. In addition, not everyone is a candidate for transplantation or can find a suitable donor. Immunosuppressants For people who can&apos;t undergo a bone marrow transplant or for those whose aplastic anemia may be due to an autoimmune disorder, treatment may involve drugs that alter or suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants). Drugs such as cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune) and anti-thymocyte globulin are examples. These drugs suppress the activity of immune cells that are damaging your bone marrow. This helps your bone marrow recover and generate new blood cells. Cyclosporine and anti-thymocyte globulin are often used in combination. Corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone (Medrol, Solu-Medrol), are often given at the same time as these drugs. Immune-suppressing drugs can be very effective at treating aplastic anemia. The downside is that these drugs further weaken your immune system. It&apos;s also possible that after you stop taking these drugs, aplastic anemia may return. Bone marrow stimulants Certain drugs - including colony-stimulating factors, such as sargramostim (Leukine), filgrastim (Neupogen) and pegfilgrastim (Neulasta), and epoetin alfa (Epogen, Procrit) - may help stimulate the bone marrow to produce new blood cells. Growth factors are often used in combination with immune-suppressing drugs. Antibiotics, antivirals Having aplastic anemia weakens your immune system. You have fewer white blood cells in circulation to fight off germs. This leaves you susceptible to infections. At the first sign of infection, such as a fever, see your doctor. You don&apos;t want the infection to get worse, because it could prove life-threatening. If you have severe aplastic anemia, your doctor may give you antibiotics or antiviral medications to help prevent infections. Other treatments Aplastic anemia caused by radiation and chemotherapy treatments for cancer usually improves once you complete those treatments. The same is true for most other drugs that induce aplastic anemia. Pregnant women with aplastic anemia are treated with blood transfusions. For many women, pregnancy-related aplastic anemia improves once the pregnancy ends. If that doesn&apos;t happen, treatment is still necessary.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Fanconi anemia (Treatment): People with mild to moderate blood cell changes who do not need a transfusion may only need regular check-ups and blood count checks. The health care provider will closely monitor the person for other cancers. These may include leukemia or cancers of the head, neck, or urinary system. Medicines called growth factors (such as erythropoietin, G-CSF, and GM-CSF) can improve blood counts for a short while. A bone marrow transplant can cure the blood count problems of Fanconi anemia. (The best bone marrow donor is a brother or sister whose tissue type matches the person affected by Fanconi anemia.) People who have had a successful bone marrow transplant still need regular check-ups because of the risk for additional cancers. Hormone therapy combined with low doses of steroids (such as hydrocortisone or prednisone) is prescribed to those who do not have a bone marrow donor. Most people respond to hormone therapy. But everyone with the disorder will quickly get worse when the drugs are stopped. In most cases, these drugs eventually stop working. Additional treatments may include: - Antibiotics (possibly given through a vein) to treat infections - Blood transfusions to treat symptoms due to low blood counts Most people with this condition visit a a doctor who is blood disorder specialist (hematologist), a doctor who treats diseases related to glands (endocrinologist), and an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) regularly. They also may see a bone doctor (orthopedist), gynecologist, or kidney disease specialist (nephrologist).</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Anemia (Treatment): Anemia treatment depends on the cause. - Iron deficiency anemia. Treatment for this form of anemia usually involves taking iron supplements and making changes to your diet. If the underlying cause of iron deficiency is loss of blood - other than from menstruation - the source of the bleeding must be located and stopped. This may involve surgery. - Vitamin deficiency anemias. Treatment for folic acid and B-12 deficiency involves dietary supplements and increasing these nutrients in your diet. If your digestive system has trouble absorbing vitamin B-12 from the food you eat, you may need vitamin B-12 shots. At first, you may receive the shots every other day. Eventually, you&apos;ll need shots just once a month, which may continue for life, depending on your situation. - Anemia of chronic disease. There&apos;s no specific treatment for this type of anemia. Doctors focus on treating the underlying disease. If symptoms become severe, a blood transfusion or injections of synthetic erythropoietin, a hormone normally produced by your kidneys, may help stimulate red blood cell production and ease fatigue. - Aplastic anemia. Treatment for this anemia may include blood transfusions to boost levels of red blood cells. You may need a bone marrow transplant if your bone marrow is diseased and can&apos;t make healthy blood cells. - Anemias associated with bone marrow disease. Treatment of these various diseases can include medication, chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation. - Hemolytic anemias. Managing hemolytic anemias includes avoiding suspect medications, treating related infections and taking drugs that suppress your immune system, which may be attacking your red blood cells. Depending on the severity of your anemia, a blood transfusion or plasmapheresis may be necessary. Plasmapheresis is a type of blood-filtering procedure. In certain cases, removal of the spleen can be helpful. - Sickle cell anemia. Treatment for this anemia may include the administration of oxygen, pain-relieving drugs, and oral and intravenous fluids to reduce pain and prevent complications. Doctors also may recommend blood transfusions, folic acid supplements and antibiotics. A bone marrow transplant may be an effective treatment in some circumstances. A cancer drug called hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea) also is used to treat sickle cell anemia. - Thalassemia. This anemia may be treated with blood transfusions, folic acid supplements, medication, removal of the spleen (splenectomy), or a blood and bone marrow stem cell transplant.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Sideroblastic anemia (Treatment): The treatment of sideroblastic anemia may differ depending on whether the underlying cause is inherited or acquired. For acquired cases, avoidance or removal of the toxin or causative medication may lead to recovery. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) therapy may be beneficial in both inherited and acquired forms. If vitamin B6 therapy is not effective, a blood transfusion can be useful, but since it has been known to worsen iron overload, the benefits and limitations of this option should be carefully considered. Rarely, when all other treatment methods have been exhausted, bone marrow transplantation may be utilized. While this therapy may offer the possibility of a cure, the complications associated with transplantation surgery must be considered.

				<AnswerURL>https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sickle-cell-anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355876</AnswerURL>
				<AnswerText>Sickle cell anemia (Treatment): Bone marrow transplant, also known as stem cell transplant, offers the only potential cure for sickle cell anemia. It&apos;s usually reserved for people younger than age 16 because the risks increase for people older than 16. Finding a donor is difficult, and the procedure has serious risks associated with it, including death. As a result, treatment for sickle cell anemia is usually aimed at avoiding crises, relieving symptoms and preventing complications. Babies and children age 2 and younger with sickle cell anemia should make frequent visits to a doctor. Children older than 2 and adults with sickle cell anemia should see a doctor at least once a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Treatments might include medications to reduce pain and prevent complications, and blood transfusions, as well as a bone marrow transplant. Medications Medications used to treat sickle cell anemia include: - Antibiotics. Children with sickle cell anemia may begin taking the antibiotic penicillin when they&apos;re about 2 months old and continue taking it until they&apos;re at least 5 years old. Doing so helps prevent infections, such as pneumonia, which can be life-threatening to an infant or child with sickle cell anemia. As an adult, if you&apos;ve had your spleen removed or had pneumonia, you might need to take penicillin throughout your life. - Pain-relieving medications. To relieve pain during a sickle cell crisis, your doctor might prescribe pain medications. - Hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea). When taken daily, hydroxyurea reduces the frequency of painful crises and might reduce the need for blood transfusions and hospitalizations. Hydroxyurea seems to work by stimulating production of fetal hemoglobin - a type of hemoglobin found in newborns that helps prevent the formation of sickle cells. Hydroxyurea increases your risk of infections, and there is some concern that long-term use of this drug might cause problems later in life for people who take it for many years. More study is needed. Your doctor can help you determine if this drug might be beneficial for you or your child. Don&apos;t take the drug if you&apos;re pregnant. Assessing stroke risk Using a special ultrasound machine (transcranial), doctors can learn which children have a higher risk of stroke. This painless test, which uses sound waves to measure blood flow, can be used on children as young as 2 years. Regular blood transfusions can decrease stroke risk. Vaccinations to prevent infections Childhood vaccinations are important for preventing disease in all children. They&apos;re even more important for children with sickle cell anemia because their infections can be severe. Your doctor will make sure your child receives all of the recommended childhood vaccinations. Vaccinations, such as the pneumococcal vaccine and the annual flu shot, are also important for adults with sickle cell anemia. Blood transfusions In a red blood cell transfusion, red blood cells are removed from a supply of donated blood, then given intravenously to a person with sickle cell anemia. Blood transfusions increase the number of normal red blood cells in circulation, helping to relieve anemia. In children with sickle cell anemia at high risk of stroke, regular blood transfusions can decrease the risk. Transfusions can also be used to treat other complications of sickle cell anemia, or they can be given to prevent complications. Blood transfusions carry some risk, including infection and excess iron buildup in your body. Because excess iron can damage your heart, liver and other organs, people who undergo regular transfusions might need treatment to reduce iron levels. Bone marrow transplant A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, involves replacing bone marrow affected by sickle cell anemia with healthy bone marrow from a donor. The procedure usually uses a matched donor, such as a sibling, who doesn&apos;t have sickle cell anemia. For many, donors aren&apos;t available. But stem cells from umbilical cord blood might be an option. Because of the risks associated with a bone marrow transplant, the procedure is recommended only for people, usually children, who have significant symptoms and problems from sickle cell anemia. If a donor is found, the person with sickle cell anemia receives radiation or chemotherapy to destroy or reduce his or her bone marrow stem cells. Healthy stem cells from the donor are injected intravenously into the bloodstream of the person with sickle cell anemia, where they migrate to the bone marrow and begin generating new blood cells. The procedure requires a lengthy hospital stay. After the transplant, you&apos;ll receive drugs to help prevent rejection of the donated stem cells. Even so, your body might reject the transplant, leading to life-threatening complications. Treating sickle cell complications Doctors treat most complications of sickle cell anemia as they occur. Treatment might include antibiotics, vitamins, blood transfusions, pain-relieving medicines, other medications and possibly surgery, such as to correct vision problems or to remove a damaged spleen. Experimental treatments Scientists are studying new treatments for sickle cell anemia, including: - Gene therapy. Researchers are exploring whether inserting a normal gene into the bone marrow of people with sickle cell anemia will result in normal hemoglobin. Scientists are also exploring the possibility of turning off the defective gene while reactivating another gene responsible for the production of fetal hemoglobin - a type of hemoglobin found in newborns that prevents sickle cells from forming. Potential treatments using gene therapy are a long way off, however. - Nitric oxide. People with sickle cell anemia have low levels of nitric oxide in their blood. Nitric oxide is a gas that helps keep blood vessels open and reduces the stickiness of red blood cells. Treatment with inhaled nitric oxide might prevent sickle cells from clumping together. Studies on nitric oxide have shown little benefit so far. - Drugs to boost fetal hemoglobin production. Researchers are studying various drugs to devise a way to boost the production of fetal hemoglobin. This is a type of hemoglobin that stops sickle cells from forming.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Insulin, Medicines, and Other Diabetes Treatments (Do I have other treatment options for my diabetes?): When medicines and lifestyle changes are not enough to manage your diabetes, a less common treatment may be an option. Other treatments include bariatric surgery for certain people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and an &quot;artificial pancreas&quot; and pancreatic islet transplantation for some people with type 1 diabetes.Bariatric surgeryAlso called weight-loss surgery or metabolic surgery, bariatric surgery may help some people with obesity and type 2 diabetes lose a large amount of weight and regain normal blood glucose levels. Some people with diabetes may no longer need their diabetes medicine after bariatric surgery. Whether and for how long blood glucose levels improve seems to vary by the patient, type of weight-loss surgery, and amount of weight the person loses. Other factors include how long someone has had diabetes and whether or not the person uses insulin.1Recent research suggests that weight-loss surgery also may help improve blood glucose control in people with type 1 diabetes who are obese.2Researchers are studying the long-term results of bariatric surgery in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.Artificial PancreasThe NIDDK has played an important role in developing “artificial pancreas” technology. An artificial pancreas replaces manual blood glucose testing and the use of insulin shots or a pump. A single system monitors blood glucose levels around the clock and provides insulin or a combination of insulin and a second hormone, glucagon, automatically. The system can also be monitored remotely, for example by parents or medical staff.In 2016, the FDA approved a type of artificial pancreas system called a hybrid closed-loop system. This system tests your glucose level every 5 minutes throughout the day and night, and automatically gives you the right amount of insulin.You still need to manually adjust the amount of insulin the pump delivers at mealtimes. But, the artificial pancreas may free you from some of the daily tasks needed to keep your blood glucose stable—or help you sleep through the night without the need to wake and test your glucose or take medicine.The hybrid closed-loop system is expected to be available in the U.S. in 2017. Talk with your health care provider about whether this system might be right for you.The NIDDK has funded several important studies on different types of artificial pancreas devices to better help people with type 1 diabetes manage their disease. The devices may also help people with type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes.Pancreatic islet transplantationPancreatic islet transplantation is an experimental treatment for poorly controlled type 1 diabetes. Pancreatic islets are clusters of cells in the pancreas that make the hormone insulin. In type 1 diabetes, the body’s immune system attacks these cells. A pancreatic islet transplant replaces destroyed islets with new ones that make and release insulin. This procedure takes islets from the pancreas of an organ donor and transfers them to a person with type 1 diabetes. Because researchers are still studying pancreatic islet transplantation, the procedure is only available to people enrolled in research studies.

				<AnswerText>Anemia (Diagnosis): To diagnose anemia, your doctor may ask you about your medical and family history, perform a physical exam, and run the following tests: - Complete blood count (CBC). A CBC is used to count the number of blood cells in a sample of your blood. For anemia your doctor will be interested in the levels of the red blood cells contained in the blood (hematocrit) and the hemoglobin in your blood. Normal adult hematocrit values vary from one medical practice to another but are generally between 40 and 52 percent for men and 35 and 47 percent for women. Normal adult hemoglobin values are generally 14 to 18 grams per deciliter for men and 12 to 16 grams per deciliter for women. - A test to determine the size and shape of your red blood cells. Some of your red blood cells may also be examined for unusual size, shape and color. Additional diagnostic tests If you receive a diagnosis of anemia, your doctor may order additional tests to determine the underlying cause. For example, iron deficiency anemia can result from chronic bleeding of ulcers, benign polyps in the colon, colon cancer, tumors or kidney problems. Occasionally, it may be necessary to study a sample of your bone marrow to diagnose anemia.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>How to diagnose Anemia?: Your doctor will diagnose anemia based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and results from tests and procedures. Because anemia doesn&apos;t always cause symptoms, your doctor may find out you have it while checking for another condition. Medical and Family Histories Your doctor may ask whether you have any of the common signs or symptoms of anemia. He or she also may ask whether you&apos;ve had an illness or condition that could cause anemia. Let your doctor know about any medicines you take, what you typically eat (your diet), and whether you have family members who have anemia or a history of it. Physical Exam Your doctor will do a physical exam to find out how severe your anemia is and to check for possible causes. He or she may: Listen to your heart for a rapid or irregular heartbeat Listen to your lungs for rapid or uneven breathing Feel your abdomen to check the size of your liver and spleen Your doctor also may do a pelvic or rectal exam to check for common sources of blood loss. Diagnostic Tests and Procedures You may have various blood tests and other tests or procedures to find out what type of anemia you have and how severe it is. Complete Blood Count Often, the first test used to diagnose anemia is a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC measures many parts of your blood. The test checks your hemoglobin and hematocrit (hee-MAT-oh-crit) levels. Hemoglobin is the iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood. A low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia. The normal range of these levels might be lower in certain racial and ethnic populations. Your doctor can explain your test results to you. The CBC also checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. Abnormal results might be a sign of anemia, another blood disorder, an infection, or another condition. Finally, the CBC looks at mean corpuscular (kor-PUS-kyu-lar) volume (MCV). MCV is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells and a clue as to the cause of your anemia. In iron-deficiency anemia, for example, red blood cells usually are smaller than normal. Other Tests and Procedures If the CBC results show that you have anemia, you may need other tests, such as: Hemoglobin electrophoresis (e-lek-tro-FOR-e-sis). This test looks at the different types of hemoglobin in your blood. The test can help diagnose the type of anemia you have. A reticulocyte (re-TIK-u-lo-site) count. This test measures the number of young red blood cells in your blood. The test shows whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the correct rate. Tests for the level of iron in your blood and body. These tests include serum iron and serum ferritin tests. Transferrin level and total iron-binding capacity tests also measure iron levels. Because anemia has many causes, you also might be tested for conditions such as kidney failure, lead poisoning (in children), and vitamin deficiencies (lack of vitamins, such as B12 and folic acid). If your doctor thinks that you have anemia due to internal bleeding, he or she may suggest several tests to look for the source of the bleeding. A test to check the stool for blood might be done in your doctor&apos;s office or at home. Your doctor can give you a kit to help you get a sample at home. He or she will tell you to bring the sample back to the office or send it to a laboratory. If blood is found in the stool, you may have other tests to find the source of the bleeding. One such test is endoscopy (en-DOS-ko-pe). For this test, a tube with a tiny camera is used to view the lining of the digestive tract. Your doctor also may want to do bone marrow tests. These tests show whether your bone marrow is healthy and making enough blood cells.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Hemolytic Anemia (Diagnosis): Your doctor will diagnose hemolytic anemia based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results. Specialists Involved Primary care doctors, such as a family doctor or pediatrician, may help diagnose and treat hemolytic anemia. Your primary care doctor also may refer you to a hematologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood diseases and disorders. Doctors and clinics that specialize in treating inherited blood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemias, also may be involved. If your hemolytic anemia is inherited, you may want to consult a genetic counselor. A counselor can help you understand your risk of having a child who has the condition. He or she also can explain the choices that are available to you. Medical and Family Histories To find the cause and severity of hemolytic anemia, your doctor may ask detailed questions about your symptoms, personal medical history, and your family medical history. He or she may ask whether: You or anyone in your family has had problems with anemia You&apos;ve recently had any illnesses or medical conditions You take any medicines, and which ones You&apos;ve been exposed to certain chemicals or substances You have an artificial heart valve or other medical device that could damage your red blood cells Physical Exam Your doctor will do a physical exam to check for signs of hemolytic anemia. He or she will try to find out how severe the condition is and what&apos;s causing it. The exam may include: Checking for jaundice (a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes) Listening to your heart for rapid or irregular heartbeats Listening for rapid or uneven breathing Feeling your abdomen to check the size of your spleen Doing a pelvic and rectal exam to check for internal bleeding Diagnostic Tests and Procedures Many tests are used to diagnose hemolytic anemia.

Other Blood Tests If the CBC results confirm that you have anemia, you may need other blood tests to find out what type of anemia you have and how severe it is. Reticulocyte count. A reticulocyte (re-TIK-u-lo-site) count measures the number of young red blood cells in your blood. The test shows whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the correct rate. People who have hemolytic anemia usually have high reticulocyte counts because their bone marrow is working hard to replace the destroyed red blood cells. Peripheral smear. For this test, your doctor will look at your red blood cells through a microscope. Some types of hemolytic anemia change the normal shape of red blood cells. Coombs&apos; test. This test can show whether your body is making antibodies (proteins) to destroy red blood cells. Haptoglobin, bilirubin, and liver function tests. When red blood cells break down, they release hemoglobin into the bloodstream. The hemoglobin combines with a chemical called haptoglobin. A low level of haptoglobin in the bloodstream is a sign of hemolytic anemia. Hemoglobin is broken down into a compound called bilirubin. High levels of bilirubin in the bloodstream may be a sign of hemolytic anemia. High levels of this compound also occur with some liver and gallbladder diseases. Thus, you may need liver function tests to find out what&apos;s causing the high bilirubin levels. Hemoglobin electrophoresis. This test looks at the different types of hemoglobin in your blood. It can help diagnose the type of anemia you have. Testing for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). In PNH, the red blood cells are missing certain proteins. The test for PNH can detect red blood cells that are missing these proteins. Osmotic fragility test. This test looks for red blood cells that are more fragile than normal. These cells may be a sign of hereditary spherocytosis (an inherited type of hemolytic anemia). Testing for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. In G6PD deficiency, the red blood cells are missing an important enzyme called G6PD. The test for G6PD deficiency looks for this enzyme in a sample of blood. Urine Test A urine test will look for the presence of free hemoglobin (a protein that carries oxygen in the blood) and iron. Bone Marrow Tests Bone marrow tests show whether your bone marrow is healthy and making enough blood cells. The two bone marrow tests are aspiration (as-pi-RA-shun) and biopsy. For a bone marrow aspiration, your doctor removes a small amount of fluid bone marrow through a needle. The sample is examined under a microscope to check for faulty cells. A bone marrow biopsy may be done at the same time as an aspiration or afterward. For this test, your doctor removes a small amount of bone marrow tissue through a needle. The tissue is examined to check the number and type of cells in the bone marrow. You may not need bone marrow tests if blood tests show what&apos;s causing your hemolytic anemia. Tests for Other Causes of Anemia Because anemia has many causes, you may have tests for conditions such as: Kidney failure Lead poisoning Vitamin or iron deficiency Newborn Testing for Sickle Cell Anemia and G6PD Deficiency All States mandate screening for sickle cell anemia as part of their newborn screening programs. Some States also mandate screening for G6PD deficiency. These inherited types of hemolytic anemia can be detected with routine blood tests. Diagnosing these conditions as early as possible is important so that children can get proper treatment.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Fanconi Anemia (Diagnosis): People who have Fanconi anemia (FA) are born with the disorder. They may or may not show signs or symptoms of it at birth. For this reason, FA isn&apos;t always diagnosed when a person is born. In fact, most people who have the disorder are diagnosed between the ages of 2 and 15 years. The tests used to diagnose FA depend on a person&apos;s age and symptoms. In all cases, medical and family histories are an important part of diagnosing FA. However, because FA has many of the same signs and symptoms as other diseases, only genetic testing can confirm its diagnosis. Specialists Involved A geneticist is a doctor or scientist who studies how genes work and how diseases and traits are passed from parents to children through genes. Geneticists do genetic testing for FA. They also can provide counseling about how FA is inherited and the types of prenatal (before birth) testing used to diagnose it. An obstetrician may detect birth defects linked to FA before your child is born. An obstetrician is a doctor who specializes in providing care for pregnant women. After your child is born, a pediatrician also can help find out whether your child has FA. A pediatrician is a doctor who specializes in treating children and teens. A hematologist (blood disease specialist) also may help diagnose FA. Family and Medical Histories FA is an inherited disease. Some parents are aware that their family has a medical history of FA, even if they don&apos;t have the disease. Other parents, especially if they&apos;re FA carriers, may not be aware of a family history of FA. Many parents may not know that FA can be passed from parents to children. Knowing your family medical history can help your doctor diagnose whether you or your child has FA or another condition with similar symptoms. If your doctor thinks that you, your siblings, or your children have FA, he or she may ask you detailed questions about: Any personal or family history of anemia Any surgeries you’ve had related to the digestive system Any personal or family history of immune disorders Your appetite, eating habits, and any medicines you take If you know your family has a history of FA, or if your answers to your doctor&apos;s questions suggest a possible diagnosis of FA, your doctor will recommend further testing. Diagnostic Tests and Procedures The signs and symptoms of FA aren&apos;t unique to the disease. They&apos;re also linked to many other diseases and conditions, such as aplastic anemia. For this reason, genetic testing is needed to confirm a diagnosis of FA. Genetic tests for FA include the following. Chromosome Breakage Test This is the most common test for FA. It&apos;s available only in special laboratories (labs). It shows whether your chromosomes (long chains of genes) break more easily than normal. Skin cells sometimes are used for the test. Usually, though, a small amount of blood is taken from a vein in your arm using a needle. A technician combines some of the blood cells with certain chemicals. If you have FA, the chromosomes in your blood sample break and rearrange when mixed with the test chemicals. This doesn&apos;t happen in the cells of people who don&apos;t have FA. Cytometric Flow Analysis Cytometric flow analysis, or CFA, is done in a lab. This test examines how chemicals affect your chromosomes as your cells grow and divide. Skin cells are used for this test. A technician mixes the skin cells with chemicals that can cause the chromosomes in the cells to act abnormally. If you have FA, your cells are much more sensitive to these chemicals. The chromosomes in your skin cells will break at a high rate during the test. This doesn&apos;t happen in the cells of people who don&apos;t have FA. Mutation Screening A mutation is an abnormal change in a gene or genes. Geneticists and other specialists can examine your genes, usually using a sample of your skin cells. With special equipment and lab processes, they can look for gene mutations that are linked to FA. Diagnosing Different Age Groups Before Birth (Prenatal) If your family has a history of FA and you get pregnant, your doctor may want to test you or your fetus for FA. Two tests can be used to diagnose FA in a developing fetus: amniocentesis (AM-ne-o-sen-TE-sis) and chorionic villus (ko-re-ON-ik VIL-us) sampling (CVS). Both tests are done in a doctor&apos;s office or hospital. Amniocentesis is done 15 to 18 weeks after a pregnant woman&apos;s last period. A doctor uses a needle to remove a small amount of fluid from the sac around the fetus. A technician tests chromosomes (chains of genes) from the fluid sample to see whether they have faulty genes associated with FA. CVS is done 10 to 12 weeks after a pregnant woman&apos;s last period. A doctor inserts a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta (the temporary organ that connects the fetus to the mother). The doctor removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction. The tissue sample is sent to a lab to be tested for genetic defects associated with FA. At Birth Three out of four people who inherit FA are born with birth defects. If your baby is born with certain birth defects, your doctor may recommend genetic testing to confirm a diagnosis of FA. For more information about these defects, go to “What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Fanconi Anemia?” Childhood and Later Some people who have FA are not born with birth defects. Doctors may not diagnose them with the disorder until signs of bone marrow failure or cancer occur. This usually happens within the first 10 years of life. Signs of bone marrow failure most often begin between the ages of 3 and 12 years, with 7 to 8 years as the most common ages. However, 10 percent of children who have FA aren&apos;t diagnosed until after 16 years of age. If your bone marrow is failing, you may have signs of aplastic anemia. FA is one type of aplastic anemia. In aplastic anemia, your bone marrow stops making or doesn&apos;t make enough of all three types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Aplastic anemia can be inherited or acquired after birth through exposure to chemicals, radiation, or medicines. Doctors diagnose aplastic anemia using: Family and medical histories and a physical exam. A complete blood count (CBC) to check the number, size, and condition of your red blood cells. The CBC also checks numbers of white blood cells and platelets. A reticulocyte (re-TIK-u-lo-site) count. This test counts the number of new red blood cells in your blood to see whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the proper rate. Bone marrow tests. For a bone marrow aspiration, a small amount of liquid bone marrow is removed and tested to see whether it&apos;s making enough blood cells. For a bone marrow biopsy, a small amount of bone marrow tissue is removed and tested to see whether it&apos;s making enough blood cells. If you or your child is diagnosed with aplastic anemia, your doctor will want to find the cause. If your doctor suspects you have FA, he or she may recommend genetic testing.

				<AnswerText>Pernicious Anemia (Diagnosis): Your doctor will diagnose pernicious anemia based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results. Your doctor will want to find out whether the condition is due to a lack of intrinsic factor or another cause. He or she also will want to find out the severity of the condition, so it can be properly treated. Specialists Involved Primary care doctors—such as family doctors, internists, and pediatricians (doctors who treat children)—often diagnose and treat pernicious anemia. Other kinds of doctors also may be involved, including: A neurologist (nervous system specialist) A cardiologist (heart specialist) A hematologist (blood disease specialist) A gastroenterologist (digestive tract specialist) Medical and Family Histories Your doctor may ask about your signs and symptoms. He or she also may ask: Whether you&apos;ve had any stomach or intestinal surgeries Whether you have any digestive disorders, such as celiac disease or Crohn&apos;s disease About your diet and any medicines you take Whether you have a family history of anemia or pernicious anemia Whether you have a family history of autoimmune disorders (such as Addison&apos;s disease, type 1 diabetes, Graves&apos; disease, or vitiligo). Research suggests a link may exist between these autoimmune disorders and pernicious anemia that&apos;s caused by an autoimmune response. Physical Exam During the physical exam, your doctor may check for pale or yellowish skin and an enlarged liver. He or she may listen to your heart for rapid or irregular heartbeats or a heart murmur. Your doctor also may check for signs of nerve damage. He or she may want to see how well your muscles, eyes, senses, and reflexes work. Your doctor may ask questions or do tests to check your mental status, coordination, and ability to walk. Diagnostic Tests and Procedures Blood tests and procedures can help diagnose pernicious anemia and find out what&apos;s causing it. Complete Blood Count Often, the first test used to diagnose many types of anemia is a complete blood count (CBC). This test measures many parts of your blood. For this test, a small amount of blood is drawn from a vein (usually in your arm) using a needle. A CBC checks your hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin) and hematocrit (hee-MAT-oh-crit) levels. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood. A low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia. The normal range of these levels may be lower in certain racial and ethnic populations. Your doctor can explain your test results to you. The CBC also checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (PLATE-lets) in your blood. Abnormal results may be a sign of anemia, another blood disorder, an infection, or another condition. Finally, the CBC looks at mean corpuscular (kor-PUS-kyu-lar) volume (MCV). MCV is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells. MCV can be a clue as to what&apos;s causing your anemia. In pernicious anemia, the red blood cells tend to be larger than normal. Other Blood Tests If the CBC results confirm that you have anemia, you may need other blood tests to find out what type of anemia you have. A reticulocyte (re-TIK-u-lo-site) count measures the number of young red blood cells in your blood. The test shows whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the correct rate. People who have pernicious anemia have low reticulocyte counts. Serum folate, iron, and iron-binding capacity tests also can help show whether you have pernicious anemia or another type of anemia. Another common test, called the Combined Binding Luminescence Test, sometimes gives false results. Scientists are working to develop a more reliable test. Your doctor may recommend other blood tests to check: Your vitamin B12 level. A low level of vitamin B12 in the blood indicates pernicious anemia. However, a falsely normal or high value of vitamin B12 in the blood may occur if antibodies interfere with the test. Your homocysteine and methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels. High levels of these substances in your body are a sign of pernicious anemia. For intrinsic factor antibodies and parietal cell antibodies. These antibodies also are a sign of pernicious anemia. Bone Marrow Tests Bone marrow tests can show whether your bone marrow is healthy and making enough red blood cells. The two bone marrow tests are aspiration (as-pi-RA-shun) and biopsy. For aspiration, your doctor removes a small amount of fluid bone marrow through a needle. For a biopsy, your doctor removes a small amount of bone marrow tissue through a larger needle. The samples are then examined under a microscope. In pernicious anemia, the bone marrow cells that turn into blood cells are larger than normal.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerURL>https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sickle-cell-anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355876</AnswerURL>
				<AnswerText>Sickle cell anemia: Sickle cell anemia is an inherited form of anemia - a condition in which there aren&apos;t enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen throughout your body. Normally, your red blood cells are flexible and round, moving easily through your blood vessels. In sickle cell anemia, the red blood cells become rigid and sticky and are shaped like sickles or crescent moons. These irregularly shaped cells can get stuck in small blood vessels, which can slow or block blood flow and oxygen to parts of the body. There&apos;s no cure for most people with sickle cell anemia. But treatments can relieve pain and help prevent problems associated with the disease. Signs and symptoms of sickle cell anemia, which vary from person to person and change over time, include: - Anemia. Sickle cells break apart easily and die, leaving you without enough red blood cells. Red blood cells usually live for about 120 days before they need to be replaced. But sickle cells usually die in 10 to 20 days, leaving a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Without enough red blood cells, your body can&apos;t get the oxygen it needs to feel energized, causing fatigue. - Episodes of pain. Periodic episodes of pain, called crises, are a major symptom of sickle cell anemia. Pain develops when sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood flow through tiny blood vessels to your chest, abdomen and joints. Pain can also occur in your bones. The pain varies in intensity and can last for a few hours to a few weeks. Some people have only a few pain episodes. Others have a dozen or more crises a year. If a crisis is severe enough, you might need to be hospitalized. Some adolescents and adults with sickle cell anemia also have chronic pain, which can result from bone and joint damage, ulcers and other causes. - Painful swelling of hands and feet. The swelling is caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells blocking blood flow to the hands and feet. - Frequent infections. Sickle cells can damage an organ that fights infection (spleen), leaving you more vulnerable to infections. Doctors commonly give infants and children with sickle cell anemia vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent potentially life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia. - Delayed growth. Red blood cells provide your body with the oxygen and nutrients you need for growth. A shortage of healthy red blood cells can slow growth in infants and children and delay puberty in teenagers. - Vision problems. Tiny blood vessels that supply your eyes may become plugged with sickle cells. This can damage the retina - the portion of the eye that processes visual images, leading to vision problems. When to see a doctor Although sickle cell anemia is usually diagnosed in infancy, if you or your child develops any of the following problems, see your doctor right away or seek emergency medical care: - Unexplained episodes of severe pain, such as pain in the abdomen, chest, bones or joints. - Swelling in the hands or feet. - Abdominal swelling, especially if the area is tender to the touch. - Fever. People with sickle cell anemia have an increased risk of infection, and fever can be the first sign of an infection. - Pale skin or nail beds. - Yellow tint to the skin or whites of the eyes. - Signs or symptoms of stroke. If you notice one-sided paralysis or weakness in the face, arms or legs; confusion; trouble walking or talking; sudden vision problems or unexplained numbness; or a headache, call 911 or your local emergency number right away. Sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in the gene that tells your body to make the red, iron-rich compound that gives blood its red color (hemoglobin). Hemoglobin allows red blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body. In sickle cell anemia, the abnormal hemoglobin causes red blood cells to become rigid, sticky and misshapen. The sickle cell gene is passed from generation to generation in a pattern of inheritance called autosomal recessive inheritance. This means that both the mother and the father must pass on the defective form of the gene for a child to be affected. If only one parent passes the sickle cell gene to the child, that child will have the sickle cell trait. With one normal hemoglobin gene and one defective form of the gene, people with the sickle cell trait make both normal hemoglobin and sickle cell hemoglobin. Their blood might contain some sickle cells, but they generally don&apos;t have symptoms. But they are carriers of the disease, which means they can pass the gene to their children. For a baby to be born with sickle cell anemia, both parents must carry a sickle cell gene. In the United States, it most commonly affects black people. Sickle cell anemia can lead to a host of complications, including: - Stroke. A stroke can occur if sickle cells block blood flow to an area of your brain. Signs of stroke include seizures, weakness or numbness of your arms and legs, sudden speech difficulties, and loss of consciousness. If your baby or child has any of these signs and symptoms, seek medical treatment immediately. A stroke can be fatal. - Acute chest syndrome. This life-threatening complication causes chest pain, fever and difficulty breathing. Acute chest syndrome can be caused by a lung infection or by sickle cells blocking blood vessels in your lungs. It might require emergency medical treatment with antibiotics and other treatments. - Pulmonary hypertension. People with sickle cell anemia can develop high blood pressure in their lungs (pulmonary hypertension). This complication usually affects adults rather than children. Shortness of breath and fatigue are common symptoms of this condition, which can be fatal. - Organ damage. Sickle cells that block blood flow through blood vessels immediately deprive the affected organ of blood and oxygen. In sickle cell anemia, blood is also chronically low on oxygen. Chronic deprivation of oxygen-rich blood can damage nerves and organs in your body, including your kidneys, liver and spleen. Organ damage can be fatal. - Blindness. Sickle cells can block tiny blood vessels that supply your eyes. Over time, this can damage the portion of the eye that processes visual images (retina) and lead to blindness. - Leg ulcers. Sickle cell anemia can cause open sores, called ulcers, on your legs. - Gallstones. The breakdown of red blood cells produces a substance called bilirubin. A high level of bilirubin in your body can lead to gallstones. - Priapism. Men with sickle cell anemia can have painful, long-lasting erections, a condition called priapism. As occurs in other parts of the body, sickle cells can block the blood vessels in the penis. This can damage the penis and lead to impotence. A blood test can check for hemoglobin S - the defective form of hemoglobin that underlies sickle cell anemia. In the United States, this blood test is part of routine newborn screening done at the hospital. But older children and adults can be tested, too. In adults, a blood sample is drawn from a vein in the arm. In young children and babies, the blood sample is usually collected from a finger or heel. The sample is then sent to a laboratory, where it&apos;s screened for hemoglobin S. If the screening test is negative, there is no sickle cell gene present. If the screening test is positive, further tests will be done to determine whether one or two sickle cell genes are present. Additional tests If you or your child has sickle cell anemia, a blood test to check for a low red blood cell count (anemia) will be done. Your doctor might suggest additional tests to check for possible complications of the disease. If you or your child carries the sickle cell gene, you&apos;ll likely be referred to a genetic counselor. Tests to detect sickle cell genes before birth Sickle cell disease can be diagnosed in an unborn baby by sampling some of the fluid surrounding the baby in the mother&apos;s womb (amniotic fluid) to look for the sickle cell gene. If you or your partner has been diagnosed with sickle cell anemia or sickle cell trait, ask your doctor about whether you should consider this screening. Ask for a referral to a genetic counselor who can help you understand the risk to your baby. Bone marrow transplant, also known as stem cell transplant, offers the only potential cure for sickle cell anemia. It&apos;s usually reserved for people younger than age 16 because the risks increase for people older than 16. Finding a donor is difficult, and the procedure has serious risks associated with it, including death. As a result, treatment for sickle cell anemia is usually aimed at avoiding crises, relieving symptoms and preventing complications. Babies and children age 2 and younger with sickle cell anemia should make frequent visits to a doctor. Children older than 2 and adults with sickle cell anemia should see a doctor at least once a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Treatments might include medications to reduce pain and prevent complications, and blood transfusions, as well as a bone marrow transplant. Medications Medications used to treat sickle cell anemia include: - Antibiotics. Children with sickle cell anemia may begin taking the antibiotic penicillin when they&apos;re about 2 months old and continue taking it until they&apos;re at least 5 years old. Doing so helps prevent infections, such as pneumonia, which can be life-threatening to an infant or child with sickle cell anemia. As an adult, if you&apos;ve had your spleen removed or had pneumonia, you might need to take penicillin throughout your life. - Pain-relieving medications. To relieve pain during a sickle cell crisis, your doctor might prescribe pain medications. - Hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea). When taken daily, hydroxyurea reduces the frequency of painful crises and might reduce the need for blood transfusions and hospitalizations. Hydroxyurea seems to work by stimulating production of fetal hemoglobin - a type of hemoglobin found in newborns that helps prevent the formation of sickle cells. Hydroxyurea increases your risk of infections, and there is some concern that long-term use of this drug might cause problems later in life for people who take it for many years. More study is needed. Your doctor can help you determine if this drug might be beneficial for you or your child. Don&apos;t take the drug if you&apos;re pregnant. Assessing stroke risk Using a special ultrasound machine (transcranial), doctors can learn which children have a higher risk of stroke. This painless test, which uses sound waves to measure blood flow, can be used on children as young as 2 years. Regular blood transfusions can decrease stroke risk. Vaccinations to prevent infections Childhood vaccinations are important for preventing disease in all children. They&apos;re even more important for children with sickle cell anemia because their infections can be severe. Your doctor will make sure your child receives all of the recommended childhood vaccinations. Vaccinations, such as the pneumococcal vaccine and the annual flu shot, are also important for adults with sickle cell anemia. Blood transfusions In a red blood cell transfusion, red blood cells are removed from a supply of donated blood, then given intravenously to a person with sickle cell anemia. Blood transfusions increase the number of normal red blood cells in circulation, helping to relieve anemia. In children with sickle cell anemia at high risk of stroke, regular blood transfusions can decrease the risk. Transfusions can also be used to treat other complications of sickle cell anemia, or they can be given to prevent complications. Blood transfusions carry some risk, including infection and excess iron buildup in your body. Because excess iron can damage your heart, liver and other organs, people who undergo regular transfusions might need treatment to reduce iron levels. Bone marrow transplant A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, involves replacing bone marrow affected by sickle cell anemia with healthy bone marrow from a donor. The procedure usually uses a matched donor, such as a sibling, who doesn&apos;t have sickle cell anemia. For many, donors aren&apos;t available. But stem cells from umbilical cord blood might be an option. Because of the risks associated with a bone marrow transplant, the procedure is recommended only for people, usually children, who have significant symptoms and problems from sickle cell anemia. If a donor is found, the person with sickle cell anemia receives radiation or chemotherapy to destroy or reduce his or her bone marrow stem cells. Healthy stem cells from the donor are injected intravenously into the bloodstream of the person with sickle cell anemia, where they migrate to the bone marrow and begin generating new blood cells. The procedure requires a lengthy hospital stay. After the transplant, you&apos;ll receive drugs to help prevent rejection of the donated stem cells. Even so, your body might reject the transplant, leading to life-threatening complications. Treating sickle cell complications Doctors treat most complications of sickle cell anemia as they occur. Treatment might include antibiotics, vitamins, blood transfusions, pain-relieving medicines, other medications and possibly surgery, such as to correct vision problems or to remove a damaged spleen. Experimental treatments Scientists are studying new treatments for sickle cell anemia, including: - Gene therapy. Researchers are exploring whether inserting a normal gene into the bone marrow of people with sickle cell anemia will result in normal hemoglobin. Scientists are also exploring the possibility of turning off the defective gene while reactivating another gene responsible for the production of fetal hemoglobin - a type of hemoglobin found in newborns that prevents sickle cells from forming. Potential treatments using gene therapy are a long way off, however. - Nitric oxide. People with sickle cell anemia have low levels of nitric oxide in their blood. Nitric oxide is a gas that helps keep blood vessels open and reduces the stickiness of red blood cells. Treatment with inhaled nitric oxide might prevent sickle cells from clumping together. Studies on nitric oxide have shown little benefit so far. - Drugs to boost fetal hemoglobin production. Researchers are studying various drugs to devise a way to boost the production of fetal hemoglobin. This is a type of hemoglobin that stops sickle cells from forming. Taking the following steps to stay healthy may help you avoid complications of sickle cell anemia: - Take folic acid supplements daily, and choose a healthy diet. Bone marrow needs folic acid and other vitamins to make new red blood cells. Your doctor might recommend a folic acid supplement. Choose a diet that focuses on a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables, as well as whole grains. - Drink plenty of water. Dehydration can increase your risk of a sickle cell crisis. Drink water throughout your day, aiming for about eight glasses a day. Increase the amount of water you drink if you exercise or spend time in a hot, dry climate. - Avoid temperature extremes. Exposure to extreme heat or cold can increase your risk of a sickle cell crisis. - Exercise regularly, but don&apos;t overdo it. Talk with your doctor about how much exercise is right for you. - Use over-the-counter (OTC) medications with caution. Use OTC pain medications, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, Children&apos;s Motrin, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve) sparingly, if at all, because of the possible effect on your kidneys. Ask your doctor before taking OTC drugs.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Sickle cell anemia: Sickle cell anemia is a disease passed down through families. The red blood cells that are normally shaped like a disc take on a sickle or crescent shape. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body. Sickle cell anemia is caused by an abnormal type of hemoglobin called hemoglobin S. Hemoglobin is a protein inside red blood cells that carries oxygen. - Hemoglobin S changes the red blood cells. The red blood cells become fragile and shaped like crescents or sickles. - The abnormal cells deliver less oxygen to the body&apos;s tissues. - They can also easily get stuck in small blood vessels and break into pieces. This can interrupt healthy blood flow and cut down even more on the amount of oxygen flowing to body tissues. Sickle cell anemia is inherited from both parents. If you get the sickle cell gene from only 1 parent, you will have sickle cell trait. People with sickle cell trait do not have the symptoms of sickle cell anemia. Sickle cell disease is much more common in people of African and Mediterranean descent. It is also seen in people from South and Central America, the Caribbean, and the Middle East. Symptoms usually do not occur until after the age of 4 months. Almost all people with sickle cell anemia have painful episodes called crises. These can last from hours to days. Crises can cause pain in the lower back, leg, joints, and chest. Some people have 1 episode every few years. Others have many episodes each year. The crises can be severe enough to require a hospital stay. When the anemia becomes more severe, symptoms may include: - Fatigue - Paleness - Rapid heart rate - Shortness of breath - Yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice) Younger children with sickle cell anemia have attacks of abdominal pain. The following symptoms may occur because small blood vessels become blocked by the abnormal cells: - Painful and prolonged erection (priapism) - Poor eyesight or blindness - Problems with thinking or confusion caused by small strokes - Ulcers on the lower legs (in adolescents and adults) Over time, the spleen stops working. As a result, people with sickle cell anemia may have symptoms of infections such as: - Bone infection (osteomyelitis) - Gallbladder infection (cholecystitis) - Lung infection (pneumonia) - Urinary tract infection Other signs and symptoms include: - Delayed growth and puberty - Painful joints caused by arthritis - Heart or liver failure due to too much iron (from blood transfusions) Tests commonly done to diagnose and monitor people with sickle cell anemia include: - Bilirubin - Blood oxygen saturation - Complete blood count (CBC) - Hemoglobin electrophoresis - Serum creatinine - Serum potassium - Sickle cell test The goal of treatment is to manage and control symptoms, and to limit the number of crises. People with sickle cell disease need ongoing treatment, even when not having a crisis. People with this condition should take folic acid supplements. Folic acid helps make new red blood cells. Treatment for a sickle cell crisis includes: - Blood transfusions (may also be given regularly to prevent stroke) - Pain medicines - Plenty of fluids Other treatments for sickle cell anemia may include: - Hydroxyurea (Hydrea), which helps reduce the number of pain episodes (including chest pain and breathing problems) in some people - Antibiotics, which help prevent bacterial infections that are common in children with sickle cell disease - Medicines that reduce the amount of iron in the body. Treatments that may be needed to manage complications of sickle cell anemia include: - Dialysis or kidney transplant for kidney disease - Counseling for psychological complications - Gallbladder removal in people with gallstone disease - Hip replacement for avascular necrosis of the hip - Surgery for eye problems - Treatment for overuse or abuse of narcotic pain medicines - Wound care for leg ulcers Bone marrow or stem cell transplants can cure sickle cell anemia, but this treatment is not an option for most people. Sickle cell anemia people often cannot find well-matched stem cell donors. People with sickle cell disease should have the following vaccinations to lower the risk of infection: - Haemophilus influenzae vaccine (Hib) - Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) - Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) Joining a support group where members share common issues can relieve the stress of a chronic disease. In the past, people with sickle cell disease often died between ages 20 and 40. Thanks to a modern care, people now can live to the age of 50 and beyond. Causes of death include organ failure and infection. Call your health care provider if you have: - Any symptoms of infection (fever, body aches, headache, fatigue) - Pain crises - Painful and long-term erection (in men) Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists and Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

				<AnswerText>Sickle cell anemia (Treatment): Bone marrow transplant, also known as stem cell transplant, offers the only potential cure for sickle cell anemia. It&apos;s usually reserved for people younger than age 16 because the risks increase for people older than 16. Finding a donor is difficult, and the procedure has serious risks associated with it, including death. As a result, treatment for sickle cell anemia is usually aimed at avoiding crises, relieving symptoms and preventing complications. Babies and children age 2 and younger with sickle cell anemia should make frequent visits to a doctor. Children older than 2 and adults with sickle cell anemia should see a doctor at least once a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Treatments might include medications to reduce pain and prevent complications, and blood transfusions, as well as a bone marrow transplant. Medications Medications used to treat sickle cell anemia include: - Antibiotics. Children with sickle cell anemia may begin taking the antibiotic penicillin when they&apos;re about 2 months old and continue taking it until they&apos;re at least 5 years old. Doing so helps prevent infections, such as pneumonia, which can be life-threatening to an infant or child with sickle cell anemia. As an adult, if you&apos;ve had your spleen removed or had pneumonia, you might need to take penicillin throughout your life. - Pain-relieving medications. To relieve pain during a sickle cell crisis, your doctor might prescribe pain medications. - Hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea). When taken daily, hydroxyurea reduces the frequency of painful crises and might reduce the need for blood transfusions and hospitalizations. Hydroxyurea seems to work by stimulating production of fetal hemoglobin - a type of hemoglobin found in newborns that helps prevent the formation of sickle cells. Hydroxyurea increases your risk of infections, and there is some concern that long-term use of this drug might cause problems later in life for people who take it for many years. More study is needed. Your doctor can help you determine if this drug might be beneficial for you or your child. Don&apos;t take the drug if you&apos;re pregnant. Assessing stroke risk Using a special ultrasound machine (transcranial), doctors can learn which children have a higher risk of stroke. This painless test, which uses sound waves to measure blood flow, can be used on children as young as 2 years. Regular blood transfusions can decrease stroke risk. Vaccinations to prevent infections Childhood vaccinations are important for preventing disease in all children. They&apos;re even more important for children with sickle cell anemia because their infections can be severe. Your doctor will make sure your child receives all of the recommended childhood vaccinations. Vaccinations, such as the pneumococcal vaccine and the annual flu shot, are also important for adults with sickle cell anemia. Blood transfusions In a red blood cell transfusion, red blood cells are removed from a supply of donated blood, then given intravenously to a person with sickle cell anemia. Blood transfusions increase the number of normal red blood cells in circulation, helping to relieve anemia. In children with sickle cell anemia at high risk of stroke, regular blood transfusions can decrease the risk. Transfusions can also be used to treat other complications of sickle cell anemia, or they can be given to prevent complications. Blood transfusions carry some risk, including infection and excess iron buildup in your body. Because excess iron can damage your heart, liver and other organs, people who undergo regular transfusions might need treatment to reduce iron levels. Bone marrow transplant A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, involves replacing bone marrow affected by sickle cell anemia with healthy bone marrow from a donor. The procedure usually uses a matched donor, such as a sibling, who doesn&apos;t have sickle cell anemia. For many, donors aren&apos;t available. But stem cells from umbilical cord blood might be an option. Because of the risks associated with a bone marrow transplant, the procedure is recommended only for people, usually children, who have significant symptoms and problems from sickle cell anemia. If a donor is found, the person with sickle cell anemia receives radiation or chemotherapy to destroy or reduce his or her bone marrow stem cells. Healthy stem cells from the donor are injected intravenously into the bloodstream of the person with sickle cell anemia, where they migrate to the bone marrow and begin generating new blood cells. The procedure requires a lengthy hospital stay. After the transplant, you&apos;ll receive drugs to help prevent rejection of the donated stem cells. Even so, your body might reject the transplant, leading to life-threatening complications. Treating sickle cell complications Doctors treat most complications of sickle cell anemia as they occur. Treatment might include antibiotics, vitamins, blood transfusions, pain-relieving medicines, other medications and possibly surgery, such as to correct vision problems or to remove a damaged spleen. Experimental treatments Scientists are studying new treatments for sickle cell anemia, including: - Gene therapy. Researchers are exploring whether inserting a normal gene into the bone marrow of people with sickle cell anemia will result in normal hemoglobin. Scientists are also exploring the possibility of turning off the defective gene while reactivating another gene responsible for the production of fetal hemoglobin - a type of hemoglobin found in newborns that prevents sickle cells from forming. Potential treatments using gene therapy are a long way off, however. - Nitric oxide. People with sickle cell anemia have low levels of nitric oxide in their blood. Nitric oxide is a gas that helps keep blood vessels open and reduces the stickiness of red blood cells. Treatment with inhaled nitric oxide might prevent sickle cells from clumping together. Studies on nitric oxide have shown little benefit so far. - Drugs to boost fetal hemoglobin production. Researchers are studying various drugs to devise a way to boost the production of fetal hemoglobin. This is a type of hemoglobin that stops sickle cells from forming.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Sickle cell anemia (Diagnosis): A blood test can check for hemoglobin S - the defective form of hemoglobin that underlies sickle cell anemia. In the United States, this blood test is part of routine newborn screening done at the hospital. But older children and adults can be tested, too. In adults, a blood sample is drawn from a vein in the arm. In young children and babies, the blood sample is usually collected from a finger or heel. The sample is then sent to a laboratory, where it&apos;s screened for hemoglobin S. If the screening test is negative, there is no sickle cell gene present. If the screening test is positive, further tests will be done to determine whether one or two sickle cell genes are present. Additional tests If you or your child has sickle cell anemia, a blood test to check for a low red blood cell count (anemia) will be done. Your doctor might suggest additional tests to check for possible complications of the disease. If you or your child carries the sickle cell gene, you&apos;ll likely be referred to a genetic counselor. Tests to detect sickle cell genes before birth Sickle cell disease can be diagnosed in an unborn baby by sampling some of the fluid surrounding the baby in the mother&apos;s womb (amniotic fluid) to look for the sickle cell gene. If you or your partner has been diagnosed with sickle cell anemia or sickle cell trait, ask your doctor about whether you should consider this screening. Ask for a referral to a genetic counselor who can help you understand the risk to your baby.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Sickle cell anemia (Complications): Sickle cell anemia can lead to a host of complications, including: - Stroke. A stroke can occur if sickle cells block blood flow to an area of your brain. Signs of stroke include seizures, weakness or numbness of your arms and legs, sudden speech difficulties, and loss of consciousness. If your baby or child has any of these signs and symptoms, seek medical treatment immediately. A stroke can be fatal. - Acute chest syndrome. This life-threatening complication causes chest pain, fever and difficulty breathing. Acute chest syndrome can be caused by a lung infection or by sickle cells blocking blood vessels in your lungs. It might require emergency medical treatment with antibiotics and other treatments. - Pulmonary hypertension. People with sickle cell anemia can develop high blood pressure in their lungs (pulmonary hypertension). This complication usually affects adults rather than children. Shortness of breath and fatigue are common symptoms of this condition, which can be fatal. - Organ damage. Sickle cells that block blood flow through blood vessels immediately deprive the affected organ of blood and oxygen. In sickle cell anemia, blood is also chronically low on oxygen. Chronic deprivation of oxygen-rich blood can damage nerves and organs in your body, including your kidneys, liver and spleen. Organ damage can be fatal. - Blindness. Sickle cells can block tiny blood vessels that supply your eyes. Over time, this can damage the portion of the eye that processes visual images (retina) and lead to blindness. - Leg ulcers. Sickle cell anemia can cause open sores, called ulcers, on your legs. - Gallstones. The breakdown of red blood cells produces a substance called bilirubin. A high level of bilirubin in your body can lead to gallstones. - Priapism. Men with sickle cell anemia can have painful, long-lasting erections, a condition called priapism. As occurs in other parts of the body, sickle cells can block the blood vessels in the penis. This can damage the penis and lead to impotence.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Sickle cell anemia (Causes): Sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in the gene that tells your body to make the red, iron-rich compound that gives blood its red color (hemoglobin). Hemoglobin allows red blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body. In sickle cell anemia, the abnormal hemoglobin causes red blood cells to become rigid, sticky and misshapen. The sickle cell gene is passed from generation to generation in a pattern of inheritance called autosomal recessive inheritance. This means that both the mother and the father must pass on the defective form of the gene for a child to be affected. If only one parent passes the sickle cell gene to the child, that child will have the sickle cell trait. With one normal hemoglobin gene and one defective form of the gene, people with the sickle cell trait make both normal hemoglobin and sickle cell hemoglobin. Their blood might contain some sickle cells, but they generally don&apos;t have symptoms. But they are carriers of the disease, which means they can pass the gene to their children.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Sickle cell anemia: Sickle cell anemia is an inherited form of anemia - a condition in which there aren&apos;t enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen throughout your body. Normally, your red blood cells are flexible and round, moving easily through your blood vessels. In sickle cell anemia, the red blood cells become rigid and sticky and are shaped like sickles or crescent moons. These irregularly shaped cells can get stuck in small blood vessels, which can slow or block blood flow and oxygen to parts of the body. There&apos;s no cure for most people with sickle cell anemia. But treatments can relieve pain and help prevent problems associated with the disease. Signs and symptoms of sickle cell anemia, which vary from person to person and change over time, include: - Anemia. Sickle cells break apart easily and die, leaving you without enough red blood cells. Red blood cells usually live for about 120 days before they need to be replaced. But sickle cells usually die in 10 to 20 days, leaving a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Without enough red blood cells, your body can&apos;t get the oxygen it needs to feel energized, causing fatigue. - Episodes of pain. Periodic episodes of pain, called crises, are a major symptom of sickle cell anemia. Pain develops when sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood flow through tiny blood vessels to your chest, abdomen and joints. Pain can also occur in your bones. The pain varies in intensity and can last for a few hours to a few weeks. Some people have only a few pain episodes. Others have a dozen or more crises a year. If a crisis is severe enough, you might need to be hospitalized. Some adolescents and adults with sickle cell anemia also have chronic pain, which can result from bone and joint damage, ulcers and other causes. - Painful swelling of hands and feet. The swelling is caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells blocking blood flow to the hands and feet. - Frequent infections. Sickle cells can damage an organ that fights infection (spleen), leaving you more vulnerable to infections. Doctors commonly give infants and children with sickle cell anemia vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent potentially life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia. - Delayed growth. Red blood cells provide your body with the oxygen and nutrients you need for growth. A shortage of healthy red blood cells can slow growth in infants and children and delay puberty in teenagers. - Vision problems. Tiny blood vessels that supply your eyes may become plugged with sickle cells. This can damage the retina - the portion of the eye that processes visual images, leading to vision problems. When to see a doctor Although sickle cell anemia is usually diagnosed in infancy, if you or your child develops any of the following problems, see your doctor right away or seek emergency medical care: - Unexplained episodes of severe pain, such as pain in the abdomen, chest, bones or joints. - Swelling in the hands or feet. - Abdominal swelling, especially if the area is tender to the touch. - Fever. People with sickle cell anemia have an increased risk of infection, and fever can be the first sign of an infection. - Pale skin or nail beds. - Yellow tint to the skin or whites of the eyes. - Signs or symptoms of stroke. If you notice one-sided paralysis or weakness in the face, arms or legs; confusion; trouble walking or talking; sudden vision problems or unexplained numbness; or a headache, call 911 or your local emergency number right away. Sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in the gene that tells your body to make the red, iron-rich compound that gives blood its red color (hemoglobin). Hemoglobin allows red blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body.

Their blood might contain some sickle cells, but they generally don&apos;t have symptoms. But they are carriers of the disease, which means they can pass the gene to their children. For a baby to be born with sickle cell anemia, both parents must carry a sickle cell gene. In the United States, it most commonly affects black people. Sickle cell anemia can lead to a host of complications, including: - Stroke. A stroke can occur if sickle cells block blood flow to an area of your brain.

Scientists are also exploring the possibility of turning off the defective gene while reactivating another gene responsible for the production of fetal hemoglobin - a type of hemoglobin found in newborns that prevents sickle cells from forming. Potential treatments using gene therapy are a long way off, however. - Nitric oxide. People with sickle cell anemia have low levels of nitric oxide in their blood. Nitric oxide is a gas that helps keep blood vessels open and reduces the stickiness of red blood cells. Treatment with inhaled nitric oxide might prevent sickle cells from clumping together. Studies on nitric oxide have shown little benefit so far. - Drugs to boost fetal hemoglobin production. Researchers are studying various drugs to devise a way to boost the production of fetal hemoglobin. This is a type of hemoglobin that stops sickle cells from forming. Taking the following steps to stay healthy may help you avoid complications of sickle cell anemia: - Take folic acid supplements daily, and choose a healthy diet. Bone marrow needs folic acid and other vitamins to make new red blood cells. Your doctor might recommend a folic acid supplement. Choose a diet that focuses on a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables, as well as whole grains. - Drink plenty of water. Dehydration can increase your risk of a sickle cell crisis. Drink water throughout your day, aiming for about eight glasses a day. Increase the amount of water you drink if you exercise or spend time in a hot, dry climate. - Avoid temperature extremes. Exposure to extreme heat or cold can increase your risk of a sickle cell crisis. - Exercise regularly, but don&apos;t overdo it. Talk with your doctor about how much exercise is right for you. - Use over-the-counter (OTC) medications with caution. Use OTC pain medications, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, Children&apos;s Motrin, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve) sparingly, if at all, because of the possible effect on your kidneys. Ask your doctor before taking OTC drugs.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Sickle cell anemia (Diagnosis): A blood test can check for hemoglobin S - the defective form of hemoglobin that underlies sickle cell anemia. In the United States, this blood test is part of routine newborn screening done at the hospital. But older children and adults can be tested, too. In adults, a blood sample is drawn from a vein in the arm. In young children and babies, the blood sample is usually collected from a finger or heel. The sample is then sent to a laboratory, where it&apos;s screened for hemoglobin S. If the screening test is negative, there is no sickle cell gene present. If the screening test is positive, further tests will be done to determine whether one or two sickle cell genes are present. Additional tests If you or your child has sickle cell anemia, a blood test to check for a low red blood cell count (anemia) will be done. Your doctor might suggest additional tests to check for possible complications of the disease. If you or your child carries the sickle cell gene, you&apos;ll likely be referred to a genetic counselor. Tests to detect sickle cell genes before birth Sickle cell disease can be diagnosed in an unborn baby by sampling some of the fluid surrounding the baby in the mother&apos;s womb (amniotic fluid) to look for the sickle cell gene. If you or your partner has been diagnosed with sickle cell anemia or sickle cell trait, ask your doctor about whether you should consider this screening. Ask for a referral to a genetic counselor who can help you understand the risk to your baby.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Sickle cell anemia (Causes): Sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in the gene that tells your body to make the red, iron-rich compound that gives blood its red color (hemoglobin). Hemoglobin allows red blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body. In sickle cell anemia, the abnormal hemoglobin causes red blood cells to become rigid, sticky and misshapen. The sickle cell gene is passed from generation to generation in a pattern of inheritance called autosomal recessive inheritance. This means that both the mother and the father must pass on the defective form of the gene for a child to be affected. If only one parent passes the sickle cell gene to the child, that child will have the sickle cell trait. With one normal hemoglobin gene and one defective form of the gene, people with the sickle cell trait make both normal hemoglobin and sickle cell hemoglobin. Their blood might contain some sickle cells, but they generally don&apos;t have symptoms. But they are carriers of the disease, which means they can pass the gene to their children.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Sickle cell anemia (Complications): Sickle cell anemia can lead to a host of complications, including: - Stroke. A stroke can occur if sickle cells block blood flow to an area of your brain. Signs of stroke include seizures, weakness or numbness of your arms and legs, sudden speech difficulties, and loss of consciousness. If your baby or child has any of these signs and symptoms, seek medical treatment immediately. A stroke can be fatal. - Acute chest syndrome. This life-threatening complication causes chest pain, fever and difficulty breathing. Acute chest syndrome can be caused by a lung infection or by sickle cells blocking blood vessels in your lungs. It might require emergency medical treatment with antibiotics and other treatments. - Pulmonary hypertension. People with sickle cell anemia can develop high blood pressure in their lungs (pulmonary hypertension). This complication usually affects adults rather than children. Shortness of breath and fatigue are common symptoms of this condition, which can be fatal. - Organ damage. Sickle cells that block blood flow through blood vessels immediately deprive the affected organ of blood and oxygen. In sickle cell anemia, blood is also chronically low on oxygen. Chronic deprivation of oxygen-rich blood can damage nerves and organs in your body, including your kidneys, liver and spleen. Organ damage can be fatal. - Blindness. Sickle cells can block tiny blood vessels that supply your eyes. Over time, this can damage the portion of the eye that processes visual images (retina) and lead to blindness. - Leg ulcers. Sickle cell anemia can cause open sores, called ulcers, on your legs. - Gallstones. The breakdown of red blood cells produces a substance called bilirubin. A high level of bilirubin in your body can lead to gallstones. - Priapism. Men with sickle cell anemia can have painful, long-lasting erections, a condition called priapism. As occurs in other parts of the body, sickle cells can block the blood vessels in the penis. This can damage the penis and lead to impotence.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Sickle cell anemia (Symptoms): Signs and symptoms of sickle cell anemia, which vary from person to person and change over time, include: - Anemia. Sickle cells break apart easily and die, leaving you without enough red blood cells. Red blood cells usually live for about 120 days before they need to be replaced. But sickle cells usually die in 10 to 20 days, leaving a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Without enough red blood cells, your body can&apos;t get the oxygen it needs to feel energized, causing fatigue. - Episodes of pain. Periodic episodes of pain, called crises, are a major symptom of sickle cell anemia. Pain develops when sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood flow through tiny blood vessels to your chest, abdomen and joints. Pain can also occur in your bones. The pain varies in intensity and can last for a few hours to a few weeks. Some people have only a few pain episodes. Others have a dozen or more crises a year. If a crisis is severe enough, you might need to be hospitalized. Some adolescents and adults with sickle cell anemia also have chronic pain, which can result from bone and joint damage, ulcers and other causes. - Painful swelling of hands and feet. The swelling is caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells blocking blood flow to the hands and feet. - Frequent infections. Sickle cells can damage an organ that fights infection (spleen), leaving you more vulnerable to infections. Doctors commonly give infants and children with sickle cell anemia vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent potentially life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia. - Delayed growth. Red blood cells provide your body with the oxygen and nutrients you need for growth. A shortage of healthy red blood cells can slow growth in infants and children and delay puberty in teenagers. - Vision problems. Tiny blood vessels that supply your eyes may become plugged with sickle cells. This can damage the retina - the portion of the eye that processes visual images, leading to vision problems. When to see a doctor Although sickle cell anemia is usually diagnosed in infancy, if you or your child develops any of the following problems, see your doctor right away or seek emergency medical care: - Unexplained episodes of severe pain, such as pain in the abdomen, chest, bones or joints. - Swelling in the hands or feet. - Abdominal swelling, especially if the area is tender to the touch. - Fever. People with sickle cell anemia have an increased risk of infection, and fever can be the first sign of an infection. - Pale skin or nail beds. - Yellow tint to the skin or whites of the eyes. - Signs or symptoms of stroke. If you notice one-sided paralysis or weakness in the face, arms or legs; confusion; trouble walking or talking; sudden vision problems or unexplained numbness; or a headache, call 911 or your local emergency number right away.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What are the symptoms of Sickle cell anemia?: Symptoms usually do not occur until after the age of 4 months. Almost all people with sickle cell anemia have painful episodes called crises. These can last from hours to days. Crises can cause pain in the lower back, leg, joints, and chest. Some people have one episode every few years. Others have many episodes each year. The crises can be severe enough to require a hospital stay. When the anemia becomes more severe, symptoms may include: - Fatigue - Paleness - Rapid heart rate - Shortness of breath - Yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice) Younger children with sickle cell anemia have attacks of abdominal pain. The following symptoms may occur because small blood vessels become blocked by the abnormal cells: - Painful and prolonged erection (priapism) - Poor eyesight or blindness - Problems with thinking or confusion caused by small strokes - Ulcers on the lower legs (in adolescents and adults) Over time, the spleen stops working. As a result, people with sickle cell anemia may have symptoms of infections such as: - Bone infection (osteomyelitis) - Gallbladder infection (cholecystitis) - Lung infection (pneumonia) - Urinary tract infection Other signs and symptoms include: - Delayed growth and puberty - Painful joints caused by arthritis - Heart failure due to too much iron (from blood transfusions)</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Sickle cell anemia (Treatment): Bone marrow transplant, also known as stem cell transplant, offers the only potential cure for sickle cell anemia. It&apos;s usually reserved for people younger than age 16 because the risks increase for people older than 16. Finding a donor is difficult, and the procedure has serious risks associated with it, including death. As a result, treatment for sickle cell anemia is usually aimed at avoiding crises, relieving symptoms and preventing complications. Babies and children age 2 and younger with sickle cell anemia should make frequent visits to a doctor. Children older than 2 and adults with sickle cell anemia should see a doctor at least once a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Treatments might include medications to reduce pain and prevent complications, and blood transfusions, as well as a bone marrow transplant. Medications Medications used to treat sickle cell anemia include: - Antibiotics. Children with sickle cell anemia may begin taking the antibiotic penicillin when they&apos;re about 2 months old and continue taking it until they&apos;re at least 5 years old. Doing so helps prevent infections, such as pneumonia, which can be life-threatening to an infant or child with sickle cell anemia. As an adult, if you&apos;ve had your spleen removed or had pneumonia, you might need to take penicillin throughout your life. - Pain-relieving medications. To relieve pain during a sickle cell crisis, your doctor might prescribe pain medications. - Hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea). When taken daily, hydroxyurea reduces the frequency of painful crises and might reduce the need for blood transfusions and hospitalizations. Hydroxyurea seems to work by stimulating production of fetal hemoglobin - a type of hemoglobin found in newborns that helps prevent the formation of sickle cells. Hydroxyurea increases your risk of infections, and there is some concern that long-term use of this drug might cause problems later in life for people who take it for many years. More study is needed. Your doctor can help you determine if this drug might be beneficial for you or your child. Don&apos;t take the drug if you&apos;re pregnant. Assessing stroke risk Using a special ultrasound machine (transcranial), doctors can learn which children have a higher risk of stroke. This painless test, which uses sound waves to measure blood flow, can be used on children as young as 2 years. Regular blood transfusions can decrease stroke risk. Vaccinations to prevent infections Childhood vaccinations are important for preventing disease in all children. They&apos;re even more important for children with sickle cell anemia because their infections can be severe. Your doctor will make sure your child receives all of the recommended childhood vaccinations. Vaccinations, such as the pneumococcal vaccine and the annual flu shot, are also important for adults with sickle cell anemia. Blood transfusions In a red blood cell transfusion, red blood cells are removed from a supply of donated blood, then given intravenously to a person with sickle cell anemia. Blood transfusions increase the number of normal red blood cells in circulation, helping to relieve anemia. In children with sickle cell anemia at high risk of stroke, regular blood transfusions can decrease the risk. Transfusions can also be used to treat other complications of sickle cell anemia, or they can be given to prevent complications. Blood transfusions carry some risk, including infection and excess iron buildup in your body. Because excess iron can damage your heart, liver and other organs, people who undergo regular transfusions might need treatment to reduce iron levels. Bone marrow transplant A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, involves replacing bone marrow affected by sickle cell anemia with healthy bone marrow from a donor. The procedure usually uses a matched donor, such as a sibling, who doesn&apos;t have sickle cell anemia. For many, donors aren&apos;t available. But stem cells from umbilical cord blood might be an option. Because of the risks associated with a bone marrow transplant, the procedure is recommended only for people, usually children, who have significant symptoms and problems from sickle cell anemia. If a donor is found, the person with sickle cell anemia receives radiation or chemotherapy to destroy or reduce his or her bone marrow stem cells. Healthy stem cells from the donor are injected intravenously into the bloodstream of the person with sickle cell anemia, where they migrate to the bone marrow and begin generating new blood cells. The procedure requires a lengthy hospital stay. After the transplant, you&apos;ll receive drugs to help prevent rejection of the donated stem cells. Even so, your body might reject the transplant, leading to life-threatening complications. Treating sickle cell complications Doctors treat most complications of sickle cell anemia as they occur. Treatment might include antibiotics, vitamins, blood transfusions, pain-relieving medicines, other medications and possibly surgery, such as to correct vision problems or to remove a damaged spleen. Experimental treatments Scientists are studying new treatments for sickle cell anemia, including: - Gene therapy.

				<AnswerText>Sickle cell anemia: Sickle cell anemia is an inherited form of anemia - a condition in which there aren&apos;t enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen throughout your body. Normally, your red blood cells are flexible and round, moving easily through your blood vessels. In sickle cell anemia, the red blood cells become rigid and sticky and are shaped like sickles or crescent moons. These irregularly shaped cells can get stuck in small blood vessels, which can slow or block blood flow and oxygen to parts of the body. There&apos;s no cure for most people with sickle cell anemia. But treatments can relieve pain and help prevent problems associated with the disease. Signs and symptoms of sickle cell anemia, which vary from person to person and change over time, include: - Anemia. Sickle cells break apart easily and die, leaving you without enough red blood cells. Red blood cells usually live for about 120 days before they need to be replaced. But sickle cells usually die in 10 to 20 days, leaving a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Without enough red blood cells, your body can&apos;t get the oxygen it needs to feel energized, causing fatigue. - Episodes of pain. Periodic episodes of pain, called crises, are a major symptom of sickle cell anemia. Pain develops when sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood flow through tiny blood vessels to your chest, abdomen and joints. Pain can also occur in your bones. The pain varies in intensity and can last for a few hours to a few weeks. Some people have only a few pain episodes. Others have a dozen or more crises a year. If a crisis is severe enough, you might need to be hospitalized. Some adolescents and adults with sickle cell anemia also have chronic pain, which can result from bone and joint damage, ulcers and other causes. - Painful swelling of hands and feet. The swelling is caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells blocking blood flow to the hands and feet. - Frequent infections. Sickle cells can damage an organ that fights infection (spleen), leaving you more vulnerable to infections. Doctors commonly give infants and children with sickle cell anemia vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent potentially life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia. - Delayed growth. Red blood cells provide your body with the oxygen and nutrients you need for growth. A shortage of healthy red blood cells can slow growth in infants and children and delay puberty in teenagers. - Vision problems. Tiny blood vessels that supply your eyes may become plugged with sickle cells. This can damage the retina - the portion of the eye that processes visual images, leading to vision problems. When to see a doctor Although sickle cell anemia is usually diagnosed in infancy, if you or your child develops any of the following problems, see your doctor right away or seek emergency medical care: - Unexplained episodes of severe pain, such as pain in the abdomen, chest, bones or joints. - Swelling in the hands or feet. - Abdominal swelling, especially if the area is tender to the touch. - Fever. People with sickle cell anemia have an increased risk of infection, and fever can be the first sign of an infection. - Pale skin or nail beds. - Yellow tint to the skin or whites of the eyes. - Signs or symptoms of stroke. If you notice one-sided paralysis or weakness in the face, arms or legs; confusion; trouble walking or talking; sudden vision problems or unexplained numbness; or a headache, call 911 or your local emergency number right away. Sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in the gene that tells your body to make the red, iron-rich compound that gives blood its red color (hemoglobin). Hemoglobin allows red blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body. In sickle cell anemia, the abnormal hemoglobin causes red blood cells to become rigid, sticky and misshapen. The sickle cell gene is passed from generation to generation in a pattern of inheritance called autosomal recessive inheritance. This means that both the mother and the father must pass on the defective form of the gene for a child to be affected. If only one parent passes the sickle cell gene to the child, that child will have the sickle cell trait. With one normal hemoglobin gene and one defective form of the gene, people with the sickle cell trait make both normal hemoglobin and sickle cell hemoglobin. Their blood might contain some sickle cells, but they generally don&apos;t have symptoms. But they are carriers of the disease, which means they can pass the gene to their children. For a baby to be born with sickle cell anemia, both parents must carry a sickle cell gene. In the United States, it most commonly affects black people. Sickle cell anemia can lead to a host of complications, including: - Stroke. A stroke can occur if sickle cells block blood flow to an area of your brain. Signs of stroke include seizures, weakness or numbness of your arms and legs, sudden speech difficulties, and loss of consciousness. If your baby or child has any of these signs and symptoms, seek medical treatment immediately. A stroke can be fatal. - Acute chest syndrome. This life-threatening complication causes chest pain, fever and difficulty breathing. Acute chest syndrome can be caused by a lung infection or by sickle cells blocking blood vessels in your lungs. It might require emergency medical treatment with antibiotics and other treatments. - Pulmonary hypertension. People with sickle cell anemia can develop high blood pressure in their lungs (pulmonary hypertension). This complication usually affects adults rather than children. Shortness of breath and fatigue are common symptoms of this condition, which can be fatal. - Organ damage. Sickle cells that block blood flow through blood vessels immediately deprive the affected organ of blood and oxygen. In sickle cell anemia, blood is also chronically low on oxygen. Chronic deprivation of oxygen-rich blood can damage nerves and organs in your body, including your kidneys, liver and spleen. Organ damage can be fatal. - Blindness. Sickle cells can block tiny blood vessels that supply your eyes. Over time, this can damage the portion of the eye that processes visual images (retina) and lead to blindness. - Leg ulcers. Sickle cell anemia can cause open sores, called ulcers, on your legs. - Gallstones. The breakdown of red blood cells produces a substance called bilirubin. A high level of bilirubin in your body can lead to gallstones. - Priapism. Men with sickle cell anemia can have painful, long-lasting erections, a condition called priapism. As occurs in other parts of the body, sickle cells can block the blood vessels in the penis. This can damage the penis and lead to impotence. A blood test can check for hemoglobin S - the defective form of hemoglobin that underlies sickle cell anemia. In the United States, this blood test is part of routine newborn screening done at the hospital. But older children and adults can be tested, too. In adults, a blood sample is drawn from a vein in the arm. In young children and babies, the blood sample is usually collected from a finger or heel. The sample is then sent to a laboratory, where it&apos;s screened for hemoglobin S. If the screening test is negative, there is no sickle cell gene present. If the screening test is positive, further tests will be done to determine whether one or two sickle cell genes are present. Additional tests If you or your child has sickle cell anemia, a blood test to check for a low red blood cell count (anemia) will be done. Your doctor might suggest additional tests to check for possible complications of the disease. If you or your child carries the sickle cell gene, you&apos;ll likely be referred to a genetic counselor. Tests to detect sickle cell genes before birth Sickle cell disease can be diagnosed in an unborn baby by sampling some of the fluid surrounding the baby in the mother&apos;s womb (amniotic fluid) to look for the sickle cell gene. If you or your partner has been diagnosed with sickle cell anemia or sickle cell trait, ask your doctor about whether you should consider this screening. Ask for a referral to a genetic counselor who can help you understand the risk to your baby. Bone marrow transplant, also known as stem cell transplant, offers the only potential cure for sickle cell anemia. It&apos;s usually reserved for people younger than age 16 because the risks increase for people older than 16. Finding a donor is difficult, and the procedure has serious risks associated with it, including death. As a result, treatment for sickle cell anemia is usually aimed at avoiding crises, relieving symptoms and preventing complications. Babies and children age 2 and younger with sickle cell anemia should make frequent visits to a doctor. Children older than 2 and adults with sickle cell anemia should see a doctor at least once a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Treatments might include medications to reduce pain and prevent complications, and blood transfusions, as well as a bone marrow transplant. Medications Medications used to treat sickle cell anemia include: - Antibiotics. Children with sickle cell anemia may begin taking the antibiotic penicillin when they&apos;re about 2 months old and continue taking it until they&apos;re at least 5 years old. Doing so helps prevent infections, such as pneumonia, which can be life-threatening to an infant or child with sickle cell anemia. As an adult, if you&apos;ve had your spleen removed or had pneumonia, you might need to take penicillin throughout your life. - Pain-relieving medications. To relieve pain during a sickle cell crisis, your doctor might prescribe pain medications. - Hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea). When taken daily, hydroxyurea reduces the frequency of painful crises and might reduce the need for blood transfusions and hospitalizations. Hydroxyurea seems to work by stimulating production of fetal hemoglobin - a type of hemoglobin found in newborns that helps prevent the formation of sickle cells. Hydroxyurea increases your risk of infections, and there is some concern that long-term use of this drug might cause problems later in life for people who take it for many years. More study is needed. Your doctor can help you determine if this drug might be beneficial for you or your child. Don&apos;t take the drug if you&apos;re pregnant. Assessing stroke risk Using a special ultrasound machine (transcranial), doctors can learn which children have a higher risk of stroke. This painless test, which uses sound waves to measure blood flow, can be used on children as young as 2 years. Regular blood transfusions can decrease stroke risk. Vaccinations to prevent infections Childhood vaccinations are important for preventing disease in all children. They&apos;re even more important for children with sickle cell anemia because their infections can be severe. Your doctor will make sure your child receives all of the recommended childhood vaccinations. Vaccinations, such as the pneumococcal vaccine and the annual flu shot, are also important for adults with sickle cell anemia. Blood transfusions In a red blood cell transfusion, red blood cells are removed from a supply of donated blood, then given intravenously to a person with sickle cell anemia. Blood transfusions increase the number of normal red blood cells in circulation, helping to relieve anemia. In children with sickle cell anemia at high risk of stroke, regular blood transfusions can decrease the risk. Transfusions can also be used to treat other complications of sickle cell anemia, or they can be given to prevent complications. Blood transfusions carry some risk, including infection and excess iron buildup in your body. Because excess iron can damage your heart, liver and other organs, people who undergo regular transfusions might need treatment to reduce iron levels. Bone marrow transplant A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, involves replacing bone marrow affected by sickle cell anemia with healthy bone marrow from a donor. The procedure usually uses a matched donor, such as a sibling, who doesn&apos;t have sickle cell anemia. For many, donors aren&apos;t available. But stem cells from umbilical cord blood might be an option. Because of the risks associated with a bone marrow transplant, the procedure is recommended only for people, usually children, who have significant symptoms and problems from sickle cell anemia. If a donor is found, the person with sickle cell anemia receives radiation or chemotherapy to destroy or reduce his or her bone marrow stem cells. Healthy stem cells from the donor are injected intravenously into the bloodstream of the person with sickle cell anemia, where they migrate to the bone marrow and begin generating new blood cells. The procedure requires a lengthy hospital stay. After the transplant, you&apos;ll receive drugs to help prevent rejection of the donated stem cells. Even so, your body might reject the transplant, leading to life-threatening complications. Treating sickle cell complications Doctors treat most complications of sickle cell anemia as they occur. Treatment might include antibiotics, vitamins, blood transfusions, pain-relieving medicines, other medications and possibly surgery, such as to correct vision problems or to remove a damaged spleen. Experimental treatments Scientists are studying new treatments for sickle cell anemia, including: - Gene therapy. Researchers are exploring whether inserting a normal gene into the bone marrow of people with sickle cell anemia will result in normal hemoglobin. Scientists are also exploring the possibility of turning off the defective gene while reactivating another gene responsible for the production of fetal hemoglobin - a type of hemoglobin found in newborns that prevents sickle cells from forming. Potential treatments using gene therapy are a long way off, however. - Nitric oxide. People with sickle cell anemia have low levels of nitric oxide in their blood. Nitric oxide is a gas that helps keep blood vessels open and reduces the stickiness of red blood cells. Treatment with inhaled nitric oxide might prevent sickle cells from clumping together. Studies on nitric oxide have shown little benefit so far. - Drugs to boost fetal hemoglobin production. Researchers are studying various drugs to devise a way to boost the production of fetal hemoglobin. This is a type of hemoglobin that stops sickle cells from forming. Taking the following steps to stay healthy may help you avoid complications of sickle cell anemia: - Take folic acid supplements daily, and choose a healthy diet. Bone marrow needs folic acid and other vitamins to make new red blood cells. Your doctor might recommend a folic acid supplement. Choose a diet that focuses on a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables, as well as whole grains. - Drink plenty of water. Dehydration can increase your risk of a sickle cell crisis. Drink water throughout your day, aiming for about eight glasses a day. Increase the amount of water you drink if you exercise or spend time in a hot, dry climate. - Avoid temperature extremes. Exposure to extreme heat or cold can increase your risk of a sickle cell crisis. - Exercise regularly, but don&apos;t overdo it. Talk with your doctor about how much exercise is right for you. - Use over-the-counter (OTC) medications with caution. Use OTC pain medications, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, Children&apos;s Motrin, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve) sparingly, if at all, because of the possible effect on your kidneys. Ask your doctor before taking OTC drugs.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerURL>https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sickle-cell-anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355876</AnswerURL>
				<AnswerText>Sickle cell anemia: Sickle cell anemia is an inherited form of anemia - a condition in which there aren&apos;t enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen throughout your body. Normally, your red blood cells are flexible and round, moving easily through your blood vessels. In sickle cell anemia, the red blood cells become rigid and sticky and are shaped like sickles or crescent moons. These irregularly shaped cells can get stuck in small blood vessels, which can slow or block blood flow and oxygen to parts of the body. There&apos;s no cure for most people with sickle cell anemia. But treatments can relieve pain and help prevent problems associated with the disease. Signs and symptoms of sickle cell anemia, which vary from person to person and change over time, include: - Anemia. Sickle cells break apart easily and die, leaving you without enough red blood cells. Red blood cells usually live for about 120 days before they need to be replaced. But sickle cells usually die in 10 to 20 days, leaving a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Without enough red blood cells, your body can&apos;t get the oxygen it needs to feel energized, causing fatigue. - Episodes of pain. Periodic episodes of pain, called crises, are a major symptom of sickle cell anemia. Pain develops when sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood flow through tiny blood vessels to your chest, abdomen and joints. Pain can also occur in your bones. The pain varies in intensity and can last for a few hours to a few weeks. Some people have only a few pain episodes. Others have a dozen or more crises a year. If a crisis is severe enough, you might need to be hospitalized. Some adolescents and adults with sickle cell anemia also have chronic pain, which can result from bone and joint damage, ulcers and other causes. - Painful swelling of hands and feet. The swelling is caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells blocking blood flow to the hands and feet. - Frequent infections. Sickle cells can damage an organ that fights infection (spleen), leaving you more vulnerable to infections. Doctors commonly give infants and children with sickle cell anemia vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent potentially life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia. - Delayed growth. Red blood cells provide your body with the oxygen and nutrients you need for growth. A shortage of healthy red blood cells can slow growth in infants and children and delay puberty in teenagers. - Vision problems. Tiny blood vessels that supply your eyes may become plugged with sickle cells. This can damage the retina - the portion of the eye that processes visual images, leading to vision problems. When to see a doctor Although sickle cell anemia is usually diagnosed in infancy, if you or your child develops any of the following problems, see your doctor right away or seek emergency medical care: - Unexplained episodes of severe pain, such as pain in the abdomen, chest, bones or joints. - Swelling in the hands or feet. - Abdominal swelling, especially if the area is tender to the touch. - Fever. People with sickle cell anemia have an increased risk of infection, and fever can be the first sign of an infection. - Pale skin or nail beds. - Yellow tint to the skin or whites of the eyes. - Signs or symptoms of stroke. If you notice one-sided paralysis or weakness in the face, arms or legs; confusion; trouble walking or talking; sudden vision problems or unexplained numbness; or a headache, call 911 or your local emergency number right away. Sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in the gene that tells your body to make the red, iron-rich compound that gives blood its red color (hemoglobin). Hemoglobin allows red blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body. In sickle cell anemia, the abnormal hemoglobin causes red blood cells to become rigid, sticky and misshapen. The sickle cell gene is passed from generation to generation in a pattern of inheritance called autosomal recessive inheritance. This means that both the mother and the father must pass on the defective form of the gene for a child to be affected. If only one parent passes the sickle cell gene to the child, that child will have the sickle cell trait. With one normal hemoglobin gene and one defective form of the gene, people with the sickle cell trait make both normal hemoglobin and sickle cell hemoglobin. Their blood might contain some sickle cells, but they generally don&apos;t have symptoms. But they are carriers of the disease, which means they can pass the gene to their children. For a baby to be born with sickle cell anemia, both parents must carry a sickle cell gene. In the United States, it most commonly affects black people. Sickle cell anemia can lead to a host of complications, including: - Stroke. A stroke can occur if sickle cells block blood flow to an area of your brain. Signs of stroke include seizures, weakness or numbness of your arms and legs, sudden speech difficulties, and loss of consciousness. If your baby or child has any of these signs and symptoms, seek medical treatment immediately. A stroke can be fatal. - Acute chest syndrome. This life-threatening complication causes chest pain, fever and difficulty breathing. Acute chest syndrome can be caused by a lung infection or by sickle cells blocking blood vessels in your lungs. It might require emergency medical treatment with antibiotics and other treatments. - Pulmonary hypertension. People with sickle cell anemia can develop high blood pressure in their lungs (pulmonary hypertension). This complication usually affects adults rather than children. Shortness of breath and fatigue are common symptoms of this condition, which can be fatal. - Organ damage. Sickle cells that block blood flow through blood vessels immediately deprive the affected organ of blood and oxygen. In sickle cell anemia, blood is also chronically low on oxygen. Chronic deprivation of oxygen-rich blood can damage nerves and organs in your body, including your kidneys, liver and spleen. Organ damage can be fatal. - Blindness. Sickle cells can block tiny blood vessels that supply your eyes. Over time, this can damage the portion of the eye that processes visual images (retina) and lead to blindness. - Leg ulcers. Sickle cell anemia can cause open sores, called ulcers, on your legs. - Gallstones. The breakdown of red blood cells produces a substance called bilirubin. A high level of bilirubin in your body can lead to gallstones. - Priapism. Men with sickle cell anemia can have painful, long-lasting erections, a condition called priapism. As occurs in other parts of the body, sickle cells can block the blood vessels in the penis. This can damage the penis and lead to impotence. A blood test can check for hemoglobin S - the defective form of hemoglobin that underlies sickle cell anemia. In the United States, this blood test is part of routine newborn screening done at the hospital. But older children and adults can be tested, too. In adults, a blood sample is drawn from a vein in the arm. In young children and babies, the blood sample is usually collected from a finger or heel. The sample is then sent to a laboratory, where it&apos;s screened for hemoglobin S. If the screening test is negative, there is no sickle cell gene present. If the screening test is positive, further tests will be done to determine whether one or two sickle cell genes are present. Additional tests If you or your child has sickle cell anemia, a blood test to check for a low red blood cell count (anemia) will be done. Your doctor might suggest additional tests to check for possible complications of the disease. If you or your child carries the sickle cell gene, you&apos;ll likely be referred to a genetic counselor.

It&apos;s usually reserved for people younger than age 16 because the risks increase for people older than 16. Finding a donor is difficult, and the procedure has serious risks associated with it, including death. As a result, treatment for sickle cell anemia is usually aimed at avoiding crises, relieving symptoms and preventing complications. Babies and children age 2 and younger with sickle cell anemia should make frequent visits to a doctor. Children older than 2 and adults with sickle cell anemia should see a doctor at least once a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Treatments might include medications to reduce pain and prevent complications, and blood transfusions, as well as a bone marrow transplant. Medications Medications used to treat sickle cell anemia include: - Antibiotics. Children with sickle cell anemia may begin taking the antibiotic penicillin when they&apos;re about 2 months old and continue taking it until they&apos;re at least 5 years old. Doing so helps prevent infections, such as pneumonia, which can be life-threatening to an infant or child with sickle cell anemia. As an adult, if you&apos;ve had your spleen removed or had pneumonia, you might need to take penicillin throughout your life. - Pain-relieving medications. To relieve pain during a sickle cell crisis, your doctor might prescribe pain medications. - Hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea). When taken daily, hydroxyurea reduces the frequency of painful crises and might reduce the need for blood transfusions and hospitalizations. Hydroxyurea seems to work by stimulating production of fetal hemoglobin - a type of hemoglobin found in newborns that helps prevent the formation of sickle cells. Hydroxyurea increases your risk of infections, and there is some concern that long-term use of this drug might cause problems later in life for people who take it for many years. More study is needed. Your doctor can help you determine if this drug might be beneficial for you or your child. Don&apos;t take the drug if you&apos;re pregnant. Assessing stroke risk Using a special ultrasound machine (transcranial), doctors can learn which children have a higher risk of stroke. This painless test, which uses sound waves to measure blood flow, can be used on children as young as 2 years. Regular blood transfusions can decrease stroke risk. Vaccinations to prevent infections Childhood vaccinations are important for preventing disease in all children. They&apos;re even more important for children with sickle cell anemia because their infections can be severe. Your doctor will make sure your child receives all of the recommended childhood vaccinations. Vaccinations, such as the pneumococcal vaccine and the annual flu shot, are also important for adults with sickle cell anemia. Blood transfusions In a red blood cell transfusion, red blood cells are removed from a supply of donated blood, then given intravenously to a person with sickle cell anemia. Blood transfusions increase the number of normal red blood cells in circulation, helping to relieve anemia. In children with sickle cell anemia at high risk of stroke, regular blood transfusions can decrease the risk. Transfusions can also be used to treat other complications of sickle cell anemia, or they can be given to prevent complications. Blood transfusions carry some risk, including infection and excess iron buildup in your body. Because excess iron can damage your heart, liver and other organs, people who undergo regular transfusions might need treatment to reduce iron levels. Bone marrow transplant A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, involves replacing bone marrow affected by sickle cell anemia with healthy bone marrow from a donor. The procedure usually uses a matched donor, such as a sibling, who doesn&apos;t have sickle cell anemia. For many, donors aren&apos;t available. But stem cells from umbilical cord blood might be an option. Because of the risks associated with a bone marrow transplant, the procedure is recommended only for people, usually children, who have significant symptoms and problems from sickle cell anemia. If a donor is found, the person with sickle cell anemia receives radiation or chemotherapy to destroy or reduce his or her bone marrow stem cells. Healthy stem cells from the donor are injected intravenously into the bloodstream of the person with sickle cell anemia, where they migrate to the bone marrow and begin generating new blood cells. The procedure requires a lengthy hospital stay. After the transplant, you&apos;ll receive drugs to help prevent rejection of the donated stem cells. Even so, your body might reject the transplant, leading to life-threatening complications. Treating sickle cell complications Doctors treat most complications of sickle cell anemia as they occur. Treatment might include antibiotics, vitamins, blood transfusions, pain-relieving medicines, other medications and possibly surgery, such as to correct vision problems or to remove a damaged spleen. Experimental treatments Scientists are studying new treatments for sickle cell anemia, including: - Gene therapy. Researchers are exploring whether inserting a normal gene into the bone marrow of people with sickle cell anemia will result in normal hemoglobin. Scientists are also exploring the possibility of turning off the defective gene while reactivating another gene responsible for the production of fetal hemoglobin - a type of hemoglobin found in newborns that prevents sickle cells from forming. Potential treatments using gene therapy are a long way off, however. - Nitric oxide. People with sickle cell anemia have low levels of nitric oxide in their blood. Nitric oxide is a gas that helps keep blood vessels open and reduces the stickiness of red blood cells. Treatment with inhaled nitric oxide might prevent sickle cells from clumping together. Studies on nitric oxide have shown little benefit so far. - Drugs to boost fetal hemoglobin production. Researchers are studying various drugs to devise a way to boost the production of fetal hemoglobin. This is a type of hemoglobin that stops sickle cells from forming. Taking the following steps to stay healthy may help you avoid complications of sickle cell anemia: - Take folic acid supplements daily, and choose a healthy diet. Bone marrow needs folic acid and other vitamins to make new red blood cells. Your doctor might recommend a folic acid supplement. Choose a diet that focuses on a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables, as well as whole grains. - Drink plenty of water. Dehydration can increase your risk of a sickle cell crisis. Drink water throughout your day, aiming for about eight glasses a day. Increase the amount of water you drink if you exercise or spend time in a hot, dry climate. - Avoid temperature extremes. Exposure to extreme heat or cold can increase your risk of a sickle cell crisis. - Exercise regularly, but don&apos;t overdo it. Talk with your doctor about how much exercise is right for you. - Use over-the-counter (OTC) medications with caution. Use OTC pain medications, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, Children&apos;s Motrin, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve) sparingly, if at all, because of the possible effect on your kidneys. Ask your doctor before taking OTC drugs.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Sickle cell anemia (Causes): Sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in the gene that tells your body to make the red, iron-rich compound that gives blood its red color (hemoglobin). Hemoglobin allows red blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body. In sickle cell anemia, the abnormal hemoglobin causes red blood cells to become rigid, sticky and misshapen. The sickle cell gene is passed from generation to generation in a pattern of inheritance called autosomal recessive inheritance. This means that both the mother and the father must pass on the defective form of the gene for a child to be affected. If only one parent passes the sickle cell gene to the child, that child will have the sickle cell trait. With one normal hemoglobin gene and one defective form of the gene, people with the sickle cell trait make both normal hemoglobin and sickle cell hemoglobin. Their blood might contain some sickle cells, but they generally don&apos;t have symptoms. But they are carriers of the disease, which means they can pass the gene to their children.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Sickle cell anemia (Complications): Sickle cell anemia can lead to a host of complications, including: - Stroke. A stroke can occur if sickle cells block blood flow to an area of your brain. Signs of stroke include seizures, weakness or numbness of your arms and legs, sudden speech difficulties, and loss of consciousness. If your baby or child has any of these signs and symptoms, seek medical treatment immediately. A stroke can be fatal. - Acute chest syndrome. This life-threatening complication causes chest pain, fever and difficulty breathing. Acute chest syndrome can be caused by a lung infection or by sickle cells blocking blood vessels in your lungs. It might require emergency medical treatment with antibiotics and other treatments. - Pulmonary hypertension. People with sickle cell anemia can develop high blood pressure in their lungs (pulmonary hypertension). This complication usually affects adults rather than children. Shortness of breath and fatigue are common symptoms of this condition, which can be fatal. - Organ damage. Sickle cells that block blood flow through blood vessels immediately deprive the affected organ of blood and oxygen. In sickle cell anemia, blood is also chronically low on oxygen. Chronic deprivation of oxygen-rich blood can damage nerves and organs in your body, including your kidneys, liver and spleen. Organ damage can be fatal. - Blindness. Sickle cells can block tiny blood vessels that supply your eyes. Over time, this can damage the portion of the eye that processes visual images (retina) and lead to blindness. - Leg ulcers. Sickle cell anemia can cause open sores, called ulcers, on your legs. - Gallstones. The breakdown of red blood cells produces a substance called bilirubin. A high level of bilirubin in your body can lead to gallstones. - Priapism. Men with sickle cell anemia can have painful, long-lasting erections, a condition called priapism. As occurs in other parts of the body, sickle cells can block the blood vessels in the penis. This can damage the penis and lead to impotence.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Gonorrhea: Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It is usually spread by having vaginal, oral, or anal sex. In 2014, gonorrhea affected more than 162,000 women in the United States.1 Antibiotics can treat gonorrhea. If left untreated, it can cause serious health problems, including problems getting pregnant. Gonorrhea is an STI that is caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It is an especially serious problem for women because it can damage the female reproductive organs. In 2014, gonorrhea affected more than 162,000 women in the United States.1 Gonorrhea most often affects women ages 15 to 24. But, gonorrhea is becoming more common in older women too.1 Gonorrhea is spread through: Most women with gonorrhea do not have any signs or symptoms. If you do get symptoms, they are often mild and can be mistaken for a bladder or vaginal infection. Signs or symptoms of gonorrhea depend on where you are first infected by the gonorrhea bacteria. Signs and symptoms in the genital area can include: Signs and symptoms in other parts of the body include: Gonorrhea can cause serious health problems, even if you do not have any signs or symptoms. You also need to get tested if you have any symptoms of gonorrhea. Testing is very important, because women with untreated gonorrhea can develop serious health problems. If you are tested for gonorrhea, you also need to get tested for other STIs, including chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV. There are two ways that a doctor or nurse tests for gonorrhea: A Pap test is not used to detect gonorrhea. Your doctor or nurse will give you antibiotics to treat gonorrhea. The antibiotics are usually a pill you swallow. Although antibiotics can cure gonorrhea, they cannot fix any permanent damage done to your body. For this reason, it is important to get tested and to take the antibiotics as soon as possible. For the antibiotics to work, you must finish all of the antibiotics that your doctor gives you, even if the symptoms go away. Do not share your antibiotics for gonorrhea with anyone. If symptoms do not go away after treatment, see your doctor or nurse. It is possible to get gonorrhea again if you have sex with someone who has gonorrhea. Tell your recent sex partner(s) so they can be tested and treated. Gonorrhea that is not treated can cause serious health problems in women:3 Gonorrhea is easy to treat. But you need to get tested and treated as soon as possible. If you have gonorrhea: For pregnant women, untreated gonorrhea raises the risk of: Babies born to infected mothers are at risk for: Treatment of gonorrhea as soon as it is found in pregnant women will lower the risk of these problems for both mother and baby. Your baby will get antibiotics if you have gonorrhea or if your baby has a gonorrheal eye infection. The best way to prevent gonorrhea or any STI is to not have vaginal, oral, or anal sex. If you do have sex, lower your risk of getting an STI with the following steps: The steps work best when used together. No single step can protect you from every single type of STI. Yes. It is possible to get gonorrhea, or any other STI, if you are a woman who has sex only with women. Talk to your partner about her sexual history before having sex, and ask your doctor about getting tested if you have signs or symptoms of gonorrhea.

				<AnswerText>How to diagnose Gonorrhea?: Gonorrhea can be quickly detected by looking at a sample of discharge or tissue under the microscope. This is called a gram stain. This method is fast, but it is not the most certain. Gonorrhea is most accurately detected with DNA tests. DNA tests are useful for screening. The ligase chain reaction (LCR) test is one of the tests. DNA tests are quicker than cultures. These tests can be performed on urine samples, which are easier to collect than samples from the genital area. Prior to DNA tests, cultures (cells that grow in a lab dish) were used to provide proof of gonorrhea, but are less commonly used now. Samples for a culture are most often taken from the cervix, vagina, urethra, anus, or throat. - Rarely they are taken from joint fluid or blood - Cultures can often provide an early diagnosis within 24 hours. A confirmed diagnosis is available within 72 hours. If you have gonorrhea, you should ask to be tested for other sexually transmitted infections, including chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV herpes and hepatitis.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Gonorrhea: Gonorrhea is an infection caused by a sexually transmitted bacterium that can infect both males and females. Gonorrhea most often affects the urethra, rectum or throat. In females, gonorrhea can also infect the cervix. Gonorrhea is most commonly spread during sex. But babies can be infected during childbirth if their mothers are infected. In babies, gonorrhea most commonly affects the eyes. Gonorrhea is a common infection that, in many cases, causes no symptoms. You may not even know that you&apos;re infected. Abstaining from sex, using a condom if you do have sex and being in a mutually monogamous relationship are the best ways to prevent sexually transmitted infections. In many cases, gonorrhea infection causes no symptoms. When symptoms do appear, gonorrhea infection can affect multiple sites in your body, but it commonly appears in the genital tract. Gonorrhea affecting the genital tract Signs and symptoms of gonorrhea infection in men include: - Painful urination - Pus-like discharge from the tip of the penis - Pain or swelling in one testicle Signs and symptoms of gonorrhea infection in women include: - Increased vaginal discharge - Painful urination - Vaginal bleeding between periods, such as after vaginal intercourse - Painful intercourse - Abdominal or pelvic pain Gonorrhea at other sites in the body Gonorrhea can also affect these parts of the body: - Rectum. Signs and symptoms include anal itching, pus-like discharge from the rectum, spots of bright red blood on toilet tissue and having to strain during bowel movements. - Eyes. Gonorrhea that affects your eyes may cause eye pain, sensitivity to light, and pus-like discharge from one or both eyes. - Throat. Signs and symptoms of a throat infection may include a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. - Joints. If one or more joints become infected by bacteria (septic arthritis), the affected joints may be warm, red, swollen and extremely painful, especially when you move an affected joint. When to see your doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any troubling signs or symptoms, such as a burning sensation when you urinate or a pus-like discharge from your penis, vagina or rectum. Also make an appointment with your doctor if your partner has been diagnosed with gonorrhea. You may not experience signs or symptoms that prompt you to seek medical attention. But without treatment, you can reinfect your partner even after he or she has been treated for gonorrhea. Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The gonorrhea bacteria are most often passed from one person to another during sexual contact, including oral, anal or vaginal intercourse. Factors that may increase your risk of gonorrhea infection include: - Younger age - A new sex partner - A sex partner who has concurrent partners - Multiple sex partners - Previous gonorrhea diagnosis - Having other sexually transmitted infections Untreated gonorrhea can lead to significant complications, such as: - Infertility in women. Untreated gonorrhea can spread into the uterus and fallopian tubes, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which may result in scarring of the tubes, greater risk of pregnancy complications and infertility. PID is a serious infection that requires immediate treatment. - Infertility in men. Men with untreated gonorrhea can experience epididymitis - inflammation of a small, coiled tube in the rear portion of the testicles where the sperm ducts are located (epididymis). Epididymitis is treatable, but if left untreated, it may lead to infertility. - Infection that spreads to the joints and other areas of your body. The bacterium that causes gonorrhea can spread through the bloodstream and infect other parts of your body, including your joints. Fever, rash, skin sores, joint pain, swelling and stiffness are possible results. - Increased risk of HIV/AIDS. Having gonorrhea makes you more susceptible to infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that leads to AIDS. People who have both gonorrhea and HIV are able to pass both diseases more readily to their partners. - Complications in babies. Babies who contract gonorrhea from their mothers during birth can develop blindness, sores on the scalp and infections. To determine whether the gonorrhea bacterium is present in your body, your doctor will analyze a sample of cells. Samples can be collected by: - Urine test. This may help identify bacteria in your urethra. - Swab of affected area. A swab of your throat, urethra, vagina or rectum may collect bacteria that can be identified in a laboratory. For women, home test kits are available for gonorrhea. Home test kits include vaginal swabs for self-testing that are sent to a specified lab for testing. If you prefer, you can choose to be notified by email or text message when your results are ready. You may then view your results online or receive them by calling a toll-free hotline. Testing for other sexually transmitted infections Your doctor may recommend tests for other sexually transmitted infections. Gonorrhea increases your risk of these infections, particularly chlamydia, which often accompanies gonorrhea. Testing for HIV also is recommended for anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection. Depending on your risk factors, tests for additional sexually transmitted infections could be beneficial as well. Gonorrhea treatment in adults Adults with gonorrhea are treated with antibiotics. Due to emerging strains of drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that uncomplicated gonorrhea be treated only with the antibiotic ceftriaxone - given as an injection - in combination with either azithromycin (Zithromax, Zmax) or doxycycline (Monodox, Vibramycin, others) - two antibiotics that are taken orally. Some research indicates that oral gemifloxacin (Factive) or injectable gentamicin, combined with oral azithromycin, is highly successful in treating gonorrhea. This treatment may be helpful in treating people who are allergic to cephalosporin antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone. Gonorrhea treatment for partners Your partner also should undergo testing and treatment for gonorrhea, even if he or she has no signs or symptoms. Your partner receives the same treatment you do. Even if you&apos;ve been treated for gonorrhea, you can be reinfected if your partner isn&apos;t treated. Gonorrhea treatment for babies Babies born to mothers with gonorrhea receive a medication in their eyes soon after birth to prevent infection. If an eye infection develops, babies can be treated with antibiotics.</AnswerText>

NIAID also supports research to develop topical microbicides (antimicrobial preparations that can be appled inside the vagina) to prevent gonococcal infections. Another important area of gonorrhea research concerns antibiotic (drug) resistance. This is particularly important because strains of N. gonorhoeae that are resistant to recommended antibiotic treatments have been increasing and are becoming widespread in the United States.

				<AnswerText>How to diagnose Gonorrhea?: Gonorrhea can be quickly detected by looking at a sample of discharge or tissue under the microscope. This is called a gram stain. This method is fast, but it is not the most certain. Gonorrhea is most accurately detected with DNA tests. DNA tests are useful for screening. The ligase chain reaction (LCR) test is one of the tests. DNA tests are quicker than cultures. These tests can be performed on urine samples, which are easier to collect than samples from the genital area. Prior to DNA tests, cultures (cells that grow in a lab dish) were used to provide proof of gonorrhea, but are less commonly used now. Samples for a culture are most often taken from the cervix, vagina, urethra, anus, or throat. - Rarely they are taken from joint fluid or blood - Cultures can often provide an early diagnosis within 24 hours. A confirmed diagnosis is available within 72 hours. If you have gonorrhea, you should ask to be tested for other sexually transmitted infections, including chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV herpes and hepatitis.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Gonorrhea (Treatment): Gonorrhea treatment in adults Adults with gonorrhea are treated with antibiotics. Due to emerging strains of drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that uncomplicated gonorrhea be treated only with the antibiotic ceftriaxone - given as an injection - in combination with either azithromycin (Zithromax, Zmax) or doxycycline (Monodox, Vibramycin, others) - two antibiotics that are taken orally. Some research indicates that oral gemifloxacin (Factive) or injectable gentamicin, combined with oral azithromycin, is highly successful in treating gonorrhea. This treatment may be helpful in treating people who are allergic to cephalosporin antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone. Gonorrhea treatment for partners Your partner also should undergo testing and treatment for gonorrhea, even if he or she has no signs or symptoms. Your partner receives the same treatment you do. Even if you&apos;ve been treated for gonorrhea, you can be reinfected if your partner isn&apos;t treated.

				<AnswerText>Gonorrhea: Gonorrhea is an infection caused by a sexually transmitted bacterium that can infect both males and females. Gonorrhea most often affects the urethra, rectum or throat. In females, gonorrhea can also infect the cervix. Gonorrhea is most commonly spread during sex. But babies can be infected during childbirth if their mothers are infected. In babies, gonorrhea most commonly affects the eyes. Gonorrhea is a common infection that, in many cases, causes no symptoms. You may not even know that you&apos;re infected. Abstaining from sex, using a condom if you do have sex and being in a mutually monogamous relationship are the best ways to prevent sexually transmitted infections. In many cases, gonorrhea infection causes no symptoms. When symptoms do appear, gonorrhea infection can affect multiple sites in your body, but it commonly appears in the genital tract. Gonorrhea affecting the genital tract Signs and symptoms of gonorrhea infection in men include: - Painful urination - Pus-like discharge from the tip of the penis - Pain or swelling in one testicle Signs and symptoms of gonorrhea infection in women include: - Increased vaginal discharge - Painful urination - Vaginal bleeding between periods, such as after vaginal intercourse - Painful intercourse - Abdominal or pelvic pain Gonorrhea at other sites in the body Gonorrhea can also affect these parts of the body: - Rectum. Signs and symptoms include anal itching, pus-like discharge from the rectum, spots of bright red blood on toilet tissue and having to strain during bowel movements. - Eyes. Gonorrhea that affects your eyes may cause eye pain, sensitivity to light, and pus-like discharge from one or both eyes. - Throat. Signs and symptoms of a throat infection may include a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. - Joints. If one or more joints become infected by bacteria (septic arthritis), the affected joints may be warm, red, swollen and extremely painful, especially when you move an affected joint. When to see your doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any troubling signs or symptoms, such as a burning sensation when you urinate or a pus-like discharge from your penis, vagina or rectum. Also make an appointment with your doctor if your partner has been diagnosed with gonorrhea. You may not experience signs or symptoms that prompt you to seek medical attention. But without treatment, you can reinfect your partner even after he or she has been treated for gonorrhea. Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The gonorrhea bacteria are most often passed from one person to another during sexual contact, including oral, anal or vaginal intercourse. Factors that may increase your risk of gonorrhea infection include: - Younger age - A new sex partner - A sex partner who has concurrent partners - Multiple sex partners - Previous gonorrhea diagnosis - Having other sexually transmitted infections Untreated gonorrhea can lead to significant complications, such as: - Infertility in women. Untreated gonorrhea can spread into the uterus and fallopian tubes, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which may result in scarring of the tubes, greater risk of pregnancy complications and infertility. PID is a serious infection that requires immediate treatment. - Infertility in men. Men with untreated gonorrhea can experience epididymitis - inflammation of a small, coiled tube in the rear portion of the testicles where the sperm ducts are located (epididymis). Epididymitis is treatable, but if left untreated, it may lead to infertility. - Infection that spreads to the joints and other areas of your body. The bacterium that causes gonorrhea can spread through the bloodstream and infect other parts of your body, including your joints. Fever, rash, skin sores, joint pain, swelling and stiffness are possible results. - Increased risk of HIV/AIDS. Having gonorrhea makes you more susceptible to infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that leads to AIDS. People who have both gonorrhea and HIV are able to pass both diseases more readily to their partners. - Complications in babies. Babies who contract gonorrhea from their mothers during birth can develop blindness, sores on the scalp and infections. To determine whether the gonorrhea bacterium is present in your body, your doctor will analyze a sample of cells. Samples can be collected by: - Urine test. This may help identify bacteria in your urethra. - Swab of affected area. A swab of your throat, urethra, vagina or rectum may collect bacteria that can be identified in a laboratory. For women, home test kits are available for gonorrhea. Home test kits include vaginal swabs for self-testing that are sent to a specified lab for testing. If you prefer, you can choose to be notified by email or text message when your results are ready. You may then view your results online or receive them by calling a toll-free hotline. Testing for other sexually transmitted infections Your doctor may recommend tests for other sexually transmitted infections. Gonorrhea increases your risk of these infections, particularly chlamydia, which often accompanies gonorrhea. Testing for HIV also is recommended for anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection. Depending on your risk factors, tests for additional sexually transmitted infections could be beneficial as well. Gonorrhea treatment in adults Adults with gonorrhea are treated with antibiotics. Due to emerging strains of drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that uncomplicated gonorrhea be treated only with the antibiotic ceftriaxone - given as an injection - in combination with either azithromycin (Zithromax, Zmax) or doxycycline (Monodox, Vibramycin, others) - two antibiotics that are taken orally.

				<AnswerText>Gonorrhea: Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease that can infect both men and women. Caused by the Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacterium, gonorrhea can cause infections in the genitals, rectum and throat. Although treatable, drug-resistant forms of gonorrhea are increasing. If left untreated, gonorrhea can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and increased risk of HIV infection. Gonorrhea can also be passed from mother to child and cause blindness or life-threatening infections in the infant. NIAID supports a comprehensive, multidisciplinary program of research on Neissesria gonorrhoeae (gonococci). Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease. It is most common in young adults. The bacteria that cause gonorrhea can infect the genital tract, mouth, or anus. You can get gonorrhea during vaginal, oral, or anal sex with an infected partner.

Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading gonorrhea. NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Scientists have determined the complete genetic code, or sequence (genetic blueprint), of the N. gonorrhoeae genome. They are using this information to help us better understand how the bacterium causes disease and becomes resistant to antibiotics. NIAID also supports research to develop topical microbicides (antimicrobial preparations that can be appled inside the vagina) to prevent gonococcal infections. Another important area of gonorrhea research concerns antibiotic (drug) resistance. This is particularly important because strains of N. gonorhoeae that are resistant to recommended antibiotic treatments have been increasing and are becoming widespread in the United States. These events add urgency to conduct research on and develop new antibiotics and to prevent antibiotic resistance from spreading.</AnswerText>

Fever, rash, skin sores, joint pain, swelling and stiffness are possible results. - Increased risk of HIV/AIDS. Having gonorrhea makes you more susceptible to infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that leads to AIDS. People who have both gonorrhea and HIV are able to pass both diseases more readily to their partners. - Complications in babies. Babies who contract gonorrhea from their mothers during birth can develop blindness, sores on the scalp and infections. To determine whether the gonorrhea bacterium is present in your body, your doctor will analyze a sample of cells. Samples can be collected by: - Urine test. This may help identify bacteria in your urethra. - Swab of affected area. A swab of your throat, urethra, vagina or rectum may collect bacteria that can be identified in a laboratory. For women, home test kits are available for gonorrhea. Home test kits include vaginal swabs for self-testing that are sent to a specified lab for testing. If you prefer, you can choose to be notified by email or text message when your results are ready. You may then view your results online or receive them by calling a toll-free hotline. Testing for other sexually transmitted infections Your doctor may recommend tests for other sexually transmitted infections. Gonorrhea increases your risk of these infections, particularly chlamydia, which often accompanies gonorrhea. Testing for HIV also is recommended for anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection. Depending on your risk factors, tests for additional sexually transmitted infections could be beneficial as well. Gonorrhea treatment in adults Adults with gonorrhea are treated with antibiotics. Due to emerging strains of drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that uncomplicated gonorrhea be treated only with the antibiotic ceftriaxone - given as an injection - in combination with either azithromycin (Zithromax, Zmax) or doxycycline (Monodox, Vibramycin, others) - two antibiotics that are taken orally. Some research indicates that oral gemifloxacin (Factive) or injectable gentamicin, combined with oral azithromycin, is highly successful in treating gonorrhea. This treatment may be helpful in treating people who are allergic to cephalosporin antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone. Gonorrhea treatment for partners Your partner also should undergo testing and treatment for gonorrhea, even if he or she has no signs or symptoms. Your partner receives the same treatment you do. Even if you&apos;ve been treated for gonorrhea, you can be reinfected if your partner isn&apos;t treated. Gonorrhea treatment for babies Babies born to mothers with gonorrhea receive a medication in their eyes soon after birth to prevent infection. If an eye infection develops, babies can be treated with antibiotics.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What are the treatments for Gonorrhea?: A number of different antibiotics may be used for treating this type of infection. - You may receive one large dose of oral antibiotics or take a smaller dose for seven days. - You may be given an antibiotic injection or shot, and then perhaps be sent home with antibiotic pills. - More severe cases of PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) may require you to stay in the hospital. Antibiotics are first given by IV. - Never treat yourself without being seen by your doctor first. Your health care provider will determine the best treatment. About half of the women with gonorrhea are also infected with chlamydia. Chlamydia is treated at the same time as a gonorrhea infection. You will need a follow-up visit 7 days after if your symptoms include joint pain, skin rash, or more severe pelvic or belly pain. Tests will be done to make sure the infection is gone. Sexual partners must be tested and treated to prevent passing the infection back and forth. You and your partner must finish all of the antibiotics. Use condoms until you both have finished taking your antibiotics. All sexual contacts of the person with gonorrhea should be contacted and tested. This helps prevent further spread of the infection. - In some places you may be able to take information and medicines to your sexual partner yourself. - In other places, the health department will contact your partner.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Gonorrhea: Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It is usually spread by having vaginal, oral, or anal sex. In 2014, gonorrhea affected more than 162,000 women in the United States.1 Antibiotics can treat gonorrhea. If left untreated, it can cause serious health problems, including problems getting pregnant. Gonorrhea is an STI that is caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It is an especially serious problem for women because it can damage the female reproductive organs. In 2014, gonorrhea affected more than 162,000 women in the United States.1 Gonorrhea most often affects women ages 15 to 24. But, gonorrhea is becoming more common in older women too.1 Gonorrhea is spread through: Most women with gonorrhea do not have any signs or symptoms. If you do get symptoms, they are often mild and can be mistaken for a bladder or vaginal infection. Signs or symptoms of gonorrhea depend on where you are first infected by the gonorrhea bacteria. Signs and symptoms in the genital area can include: Signs and symptoms in other parts of the body include: Gonorrhea can cause serious health problems, even if you do not have any signs or symptoms. You also need to get tested if you have any symptoms of gonorrhea. Testing is very important, because women with untreated gonorrhea can develop serious health problems. If you are tested for gonorrhea, you also need to get tested for other STIs, including chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV. There are two ways that a doctor or nurse tests for gonorrhea: A Pap test is not used to detect gonorrhea. Your doctor or nurse will give you antibiotics to treat gonorrhea. The antibiotics are usually a pill you swallow. Although antibiotics can cure gonorrhea, they cannot fix any permanent damage done to your body. For this reason, it is important to get tested and to take the antibiotics as soon as possible. For the antibiotics to work, you must finish all of the antibiotics that your doctor gives you, even if the symptoms go away. Do not share your antibiotics for gonorrhea with anyone. If symptoms do not go away after treatment, see your doctor or nurse. It is possible to get gonorrhea again if you have sex with someone who has gonorrhea. Tell your recent sex partner(s) so they can be tested and treated. Gonorrhea that is not treated can cause serious health problems in women:3 Gonorrhea is easy to treat. But you need to get tested and treated as soon as possible. If you have gonorrhea: For pregnant women, untreated gonorrhea raises the risk of: Babies born to infected mothers are at risk for: Treatment of gonorrhea as soon as it is found in pregnant women will lower the risk of these problems for both mother and baby. Your baby will get antibiotics if you have gonorrhea or if your baby has a gonorrheal eye infection. The best way to prevent gonorrhea or any STI is to not have vaginal, oral, or anal sex. If you do have sex, lower your risk of getting an STI with the following steps: The steps work best when used together. No single step can protect you from every single type of STI. Yes. It is possible to get gonorrhea, or any other STI, if you are a woman who has sex only with women. Talk to your partner about her sexual history before having sex, and ask your doctor about getting tested if you have signs or symptoms of gonorrhea.

				<AnswerText>Gonorrhea: Gonorrhea is an infection caused by a sexually transmitted bacterium that can infect both males and females. Gonorrhea most often affects the urethra, rectum or throat. In females, gonorrhea can also infect the cervix. Gonorrhea is most commonly spread during sex. But babies can be infected during childbirth if their mothers are infected. In babies, gonorrhea most commonly affects the eyes. Gonorrhea is a common infection that, in many cases, causes no symptoms. You may not even know that you&apos;re infected. Abstaining from sex, using a condom if you do have sex and being in a mutually monogamous relationship are the best ways to prevent sexually transmitted infections. In many cases, gonorrhea infection causes no symptoms. When symptoms do appear, gonorrhea infection can affect multiple sites in your body, but it commonly appears in the genital tract. Gonorrhea affecting the genital tract Signs and symptoms of gonorrhea infection in men include: - Painful urination - Pus-like discharge from the tip of the penis - Pain or swelling in one testicle Signs and symptoms of gonorrhea infection in women include: - Increased vaginal discharge - Painful urination - Vaginal bleeding between periods, such as after vaginal intercourse - Painful intercourse - Abdominal or pelvic pain Gonorrhea at other sites in the body Gonorrhea can also affect these parts of the body: - Rectum. Signs and symptoms include anal itching, pus-like discharge from the rectum, spots of bright red blood on toilet tissue and having to strain during bowel movements. - Eyes. Gonorrhea that affects your eyes may cause eye pain, sensitivity to light, and pus-like discharge from one or both eyes. - Throat. Signs and symptoms of a throat infection may include a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. - Joints. If one or more joints become infected by bacteria (septic arthritis), the affected joints may be warm, red, swollen and extremely painful, especially when you move an affected joint. When to see your doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any troubling signs or symptoms, such as a burning sensation when you urinate or a pus-like discharge from your penis, vagina or rectum. Also make an appointment with your doctor if your partner has been diagnosed with gonorrhea. You may not experience signs or symptoms that prompt you to seek medical attention. But without treatment, you can reinfect your partner even after he or she has been treated for gonorrhea. Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The gonorrhea bacteria are most often passed from one person to another during sexual contact, including oral, anal or vaginal intercourse. Factors that may increase your risk of gonorrhea infection include: - Younger age - A new sex partner - A sex partner who has concurrent partners - Multiple sex partners - Previous gonorrhea diagnosis - Having other sexually transmitted infections Untreated gonorrhea can lead to significant complications, such as: - Infertility in women. Untreated gonorrhea can spread into the uterus and fallopian tubes, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which may result in scarring of the tubes, greater risk of pregnancy complications and infertility. PID is a serious infection that requires immediate treatment. - Infertility in men. Men with untreated gonorrhea can experience epididymitis - inflammation of a small, coiled tube in the rear portion of the testicles where the sperm ducts are located (epididymis). Epididymitis is treatable, but if left untreated, it may lead to infertility. - Infection that spreads to the joints and other areas of your body. The bacterium that causes gonorrhea can spread through the bloodstream and infect other parts of your body, including your joints. Fever, rash, skin sores, joint pain, swelling and stiffness are possible results. - Increased risk of HIV/AIDS. Having gonorrhea makes you more susceptible to infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that leads to AIDS. People who have both gonorrhea and HIV are able to pass both diseases more readily to their partners. - Complications in babies. Babies who contract gonorrhea from their mothers during birth can develop blindness, sores on the scalp and infections. To determine whether the gonorrhea bacterium is present in your body, your doctor will analyze a sample of cells. Samples can be collected by: - Urine test. This may help identify bacteria in your urethra. - Swab of affected area. A swab of your throat, urethra, vagina or rectum may collect bacteria that can be identified in a laboratory. For women, home test kits are available for gonorrhea. Home test kits include vaginal swabs for self-testing that are sent to a specified lab for testing. If you prefer, you can choose to be notified by email or text message when your results are ready. You may then view your results online or receive them by calling a toll-free hotline. Testing for other sexually transmitted infections Your doctor may recommend tests for other sexually transmitted infections. Gonorrhea increases your risk of these infections, particularly chlamydia, which often accompanies gonorrhea. Testing for HIV also is recommended for anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection. Depending on your risk factors, tests for additional sexually transmitted infections could be beneficial as well. Gonorrhea treatment in adults Adults with gonorrhea are treated with antibiotics.

Some research indicates that oral gemifloxacin (Factive) or injectable gentamicin, combined with oral azithromycin, is highly successful in treating gonorrhea. This treatment may be helpful in treating people who are allergic to cephalosporin antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone. Gonorrhea treatment for partners Your partner also should undergo testing and treatment for gonorrhea, even if he or she has no signs or symptoms. Your partner receives the same treatment you do. Even if you&apos;ve been treated for gonorrhea, you can be reinfected if your partner isn&apos;t treated.

				<AnswerText>How to diagnose Gonorrhea?: Gonorrhea can be quickly detected by looking at a sample of discharge or tissue under the microscope. This is called a gram stain. This method is fast, but it is not the most certain. Gonorrhea is most accurately detected with DNA tests. DNA tests are useful for screening. The ligase chain reaction (LCR) test is one of the tests. DNA tests are quicker than cultures. These tests can be performed on urine samples, which are easier to collect than samples from the genital area. Prior to DNA tests, cultures (cells that grow in a lab dish) were used to provide proof of gonorrhea, but are less commonly used now. Samples for a culture are most often taken from the cervix, vagina, urethra, anus, or throat. - Rarely they are taken from joint fluid or blood - Cultures can often provide an early diagnosis within 24 hours. A confirmed diagnosis is available within 72 hours. If you have gonorrhea, you should ask to be tested for other sexually transmitted infections, including chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV herpes and hepatitis.</AnswerText>

If left untreated, gonorrhea can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and increased risk of HIV infection. Gonorrhea can also be passed from mother to child and cause blindness or life-threatening infections in the infant. NIAID supports a comprehensive, multidisciplinary program of research on Neissesria gonorrhoeae (gonococci). Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease. It is most common in young adults. The bacteria that cause gonorrhea can infect the genital tract, mouth, or anus. You can get gonorrhea during vaginal, oral, or anal sex with an infected partner. A pregnant woman can pass it to her baby during childbirth. Gonorrhea does not always cause symptoms. In men, gonorrhea can cause pain when urinating and discharge from the penis. If untreated, it can cause problems with the prostate and testicles. In women, the early symptoms of gonorrhea often are mild. Later, it can cause bleeding between periods, pain when urinating, and increased discharge from the vagina. If untreated, it can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which causes problems with pregnancy and infertility. Your health care provider will diagnose gonorrhea with lab tests. Treatment is with antibiotics. Treating gonorrhea is becoming more difficult because drug-resistant strains are increasing. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading gonorrhea. NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Scientists have determined the complete genetic code, or sequence (genetic blueprint), of the N. gonorrhoeae genome. They are using this information to help us better understand how the bacterium causes disease and becomes resistant to antibiotics. NIAID also supports research to develop topical microbicides (antimicrobial preparations that can be appled inside the vagina) to prevent gonococcal infections. Another important area of gonorrhea research concerns antibiotic (drug) resistance. This is particularly important because strains of N. gonorhoeae that are resistant to recommended antibiotic treatments have been increasing and are becoming widespread in the United States. These events add urgency to conduct research on and develop new antibiotics and to prevent antibiotic resistance from spreading.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Gonorrhea: Gonorrhea is an infection caused by a sexually transmitted bacterium that can infect both males and females. Gonorrhea most often affects the urethra, rectum or throat. In females, gonorrhea can also infect the cervix. Gonorrhea is most commonly spread during sex. But babies can be infected during childbirth if their mothers are infected. In babies, gonorrhea most commonly affects the eyes. Gonorrhea is a common infection that, in many cases, causes no symptoms. You may not even know that you&apos;re infected. Abstaining from sex, using a condom if you do have sex and being in a mutually monogamous relationship are the best ways to prevent sexually transmitted infections. In many cases, gonorrhea infection causes no symptoms. When symptoms do appear, gonorrhea infection can affect multiple sites in your body, but it commonly appears in the genital tract. Gonorrhea affecting the genital tract Signs and symptoms of gonorrhea infection in men include: - Painful urination - Pus-like discharge from the tip of the penis - Pain or swelling in one testicle Signs and symptoms of gonorrhea infection in women include: - Increased vaginal discharge - Painful urination - Vaginal bleeding between periods, such as after vaginal intercourse - Painful intercourse - Abdominal or pelvic pain Gonorrhea at other sites in the body Gonorrhea can also affect these parts of the body: - Rectum. Signs and symptoms include anal itching, pus-like discharge from the rectum, spots of bright red blood on toilet tissue and having to strain during bowel movements. - Eyes. Gonorrhea that affects your eyes may cause eye pain, sensitivity to light, and pus-like discharge from one or both eyes. - Throat. Signs and symptoms of a throat infection may include a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. - Joints. If one or more joints become infected by bacteria (septic arthritis), the affected joints may be warm, red, swollen and extremely painful, especially when you move an affected joint. When to see your doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any troubling signs or symptoms, such as a burning sensation when you urinate or a pus-like discharge from your penis, vagina or rectum. Also make an appointment with your doctor if your partner has been diagnosed with gonorrhea. You may not experience signs or symptoms that prompt you to seek medical attention. But without treatment, you can reinfect your partner even after he or she has been treated for gonorrhea. Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The gonorrhea bacteria are most often passed from one person to another during sexual contact, including oral, anal or vaginal intercourse. Factors that may increase your risk of gonorrhea infection include: - Younger age - A new sex partner - A sex partner who has concurrent partners - Multiple sex partners - Previous gonorrhea diagnosis - Having other sexually transmitted infections Untreated gonorrhea can lead to significant complications, such as: - Infertility in women. Untreated gonorrhea can spread into the uterus and fallopian tubes, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which may result in scarring of the tubes, greater risk of pregnancy complications and infertility. PID is a serious infection that requires immediate treatment. - Infertility in men. Men with untreated gonorrhea can experience epididymitis - inflammation of a small, coiled tube in the rear portion of the testicles where the sperm ducts are located (epididymis). Epididymitis is treatable, but if left untreated, it may lead to infertility. - Infection that spreads to the joints and other areas of your body. The bacterium that causes gonorrhea can spread through the bloodstream and infect other parts of your body, including your joints. Fever, rash, skin sores, joint pain, swelling and stiffness are possible results. - Increased risk of HIV/AIDS. Having gonorrhea makes you more susceptible to infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that leads to AIDS. People who have both gonorrhea and HIV are able to pass both diseases more readily to their partners. - Complications in babies. Babies who contract gonorrhea from their mothers during birth can develop blindness, sores on the scalp and infections. To determine whether the gonorrhea bacterium is present in your body, your doctor will analyze a sample of cells. Samples can be collected by: - Urine test. This may help identify bacteria in your urethra. - Swab of affected area. A swab of your throat, urethra, vagina or rectum may collect bacteria that can be identified in a laboratory. For women, home test kits are available for gonorrhea. Home test kits include vaginal swabs for self-testing that are sent to a specified lab for testing. If you prefer, you can choose to be notified by email or text message when your results are ready. You may then view your results online or receive them by calling a toll-free hotline. Testing for other sexually transmitted infections Your doctor may recommend tests for other sexually transmitted infections. Gonorrhea increases your risk of these infections, particularly chlamydia, which often accompanies gonorrhea. Testing for HIV also is recommended for anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection. Depending on your risk factors, tests for additional sexually transmitted infections could be beneficial as well. Gonorrhea treatment in adults Adults with gonorrhea are treated with antibiotics. Due to emerging strains of drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that uncomplicated gonorrhea be treated only with the antibiotic ceftriaxone - given as an injection - in combination with either azithromycin (Zithromax, Zmax) or doxycycline (Monodox, Vibramycin, others) - two antibiotics that are taken orally. Some research indicates that oral gemifloxacin (Factive) or injectable gentamicin, combined with oral azithromycin, is highly successful in treating gonorrhea. This treatment may be helpful in treating people who are allergic to cephalosporin antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone. Gonorrhea treatment for partners Your partner also should undergo testing and treatment for gonorrhea, even if he or she has no signs or symptoms. Your partner receives the same treatment you do. Even if you&apos;ve been treated for gonorrhea, you can be reinfected if your partner isn&apos;t treated. Gonorrhea treatment for babies Babies born to mothers with gonorrhea receive a medication in their eyes soon after birth to prevent infection. If an eye infection develops, babies can be treated with antibiotics.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Gonorrhea: Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It is usually spread by having vaginal, oral, or anal sex. In 2014, gonorrhea affected more than 162,000 women in the United States.1 Antibiotics can treat gonorrhea. If left untreated, it can cause serious health problems, including problems getting pregnant. Gonorrhea is an STI that is caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It is an especially serious problem for women because it can damage the female reproductive organs. In 2014, gonorrhea affected more than 162,000 women in the United States.1 Gonorrhea most often affects women ages 15 to 24. But, gonorrhea is becoming more common in older women too.1 Gonorrhea is spread through: Most women with gonorrhea do not have any signs or symptoms. If you do get symptoms, they are often mild and can be mistaken for a bladder or vaginal infection. Signs or symptoms of gonorrhea depend on where you are first infected by the gonorrhea bacteria. Signs and symptoms in the genital area can include: Signs and symptoms in other parts of the body include: Gonorrhea can cause serious health problems, even if you do not have any signs or symptoms. You also need to get tested if you have any symptoms of gonorrhea. Testing is very important, because women with untreated gonorrhea can develop serious health problems. If you are tested for gonorrhea, you also need to get tested for other STIs, including chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV. There are two ways that a doctor or nurse tests for gonorrhea: A Pap test is not used to detect gonorrhea. Your doctor or nurse will give you antibiotics to treat gonorrhea. The antibiotics are usually a pill you swallow. Although antibiotics can cure gonorrhea, they cannot fix any permanent damage done to your body. For this reason, it is important to get tested and to take the antibiotics as soon as possible. For the antibiotics to work, you must finish all of the antibiotics that your doctor gives you, even if the symptoms go away. Do not share your antibiotics for gonorrhea with anyone. If symptoms do not go away after treatment, see your doctor or nurse. It is possible to get gonorrhea again if you have sex with someone who has gonorrhea. Tell your recent sex partner(s) so they can be tested and treated. Gonorrhea that is not treated can cause serious health problems in women:3 Gonorrhea is easy to treat. But you need to get tested and treated as soon as possible. If you have gonorrhea: For pregnant women, untreated gonorrhea raises the risk of: Babies born to infected mothers are at risk for: Treatment of gonorrhea as soon as it is found in pregnant women will lower the risk of these problems for both mother and baby. Your baby will get antibiotics if you have gonorrhea or if your baby has a gonorrheal eye infection. The best way to prevent gonorrhea or any STI is to not have vaginal, oral, or anal sex. If you do have sex, lower your risk of getting an STI with the following steps: The steps work best when used together. No single step can protect you from every single type of STI. Yes. It is possible to get gonorrhea, or any other STI, if you are a woman who has sex only with women. Talk to your partner about her sexual history before having sex, and ask your doctor about getting tested if you have signs or symptoms of gonorrhea.

				<AnswerText>HIV/AIDS: HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, is the virus that causes AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). HIV attacks the immune system by destroying CD4 positive (CD4+) T cells, a type of white blood cell that is vital to fighting off infection. The destruction of these cells leaves people living with HIV vulnerable to other infections, diseases and other complications. As the leading U.S. government institute for HIV/AIDS research, NIAID is committed to conducting the research necessary to successfully end the fight against HIV/AIDS.  Nearly 37 million people are living with HIV around the world. In the United States, 1.2 million people are living with HIV, of whom 13 percent are unaware of their diagnosis. Although progress has been made in the global fight against HIV/AIDS, the epidemic continues in the United States and the international community. Globally, AIDS-related deaths have dropped by 45 percent since their peak in 2004. Yet the rate of HIV transmission remains unacceptably high, with 2.1 million new infections occurring worldwide in 2015 alone. NIAID-supported investigators are conducting an abundance of research on all areas of HIV infection, including developing and testing preventive HIV vaccines, prevention strategies, and new treatments for HIV infection and AIDS-associated opportunistic infections. Through laboratories and clinics on the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda, Maryland, and a vast network of supported research at universities, medical centers, and clinical trial sites around the globe, NIAID is working to better understand HIV and how it causes disease, find new tools to prevent HIV infection including a preventive vaccine, develop new and more effective treatments for people living with HIV, and hopefully, find a cure. Preventing new HIV infections is a key step toward ending the HIV pandemic as we know it. NIAID-supported researchers have worked since the early days of AIDS in the 1980s to identify prevention tools to keep people healthy. Today, an array of prevention methods are available for use in combination or on their own, and scientists continue to work to develop and improve cutting-edge tools and techniques that can work to prevent HIV in diverse populations around the world. Historically, vaccination has been the best method for protecting people from infectious diseases. While an array of techniques are available for preventing HIV infection, the development of a safe and effective HIV vaccine remains key to realizing a durable end to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. NIAID-supported scientists are working toward an HIV vaccine from two complementary angles: an empirical approach that quickly moves vaccine candidates into human testing, and a theoretical approach that designs vaccine candidates based on an understanding of the immune response to HIV infection. One of NIAID’s greatest success stories is that its research led to the development of numerous antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV/AIDS, turning what was once a uniformly fatal disease into a manageable chronic condition for many. NIAID is working to find new and more effective therapeutic products, drug classes, and combinations as well as safe and effective treatments for dangerous related co-infections and complications. NIAID is exploring therapies that suppress the amount of HIV to such low levels that an HIV-infected person would no longer need treatment because his or her immune system could keep the remaining virus in check, creating in essence a “functional cure.”</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What is Hearing Aids?: A hearing aid is a small electronic device that you wear in or behind your ear. It makes some sounds louder. A hearing aid can help people hear more in both quiet and noisy situations. Hearing aids help people who have hearing loss from damage to the small sensory cells in the inner ear. The damage can occur as a result of disease, aging, or injury from noise or certain medicines. Only about one out of five people who would benefit from a hearing aid actually uses one. If you think a hearing aid could help you, visit your doctor. There are different kinds of hearing aids. They differ by size, their placement on or inside the ear, and how much they amplify sound. The hearing aid that will work best for you depends on what kind of hearing loss you have, and how severe it is. NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>HIV/AIDS: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By damaging your immune system, HIV interferes with your body&apos;s ability to fight the organisms that cause disease. HIV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It can also be spread by contact with infected blood or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding. Without medication, it may take years before HIV weakens your immune system to the point that you have AIDS. There&apos;s no cure for HIV/AIDS, but there are medications that can dramatically slow the progression of the disease. These drugs have reduced AIDS deaths in many developed nations. The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary, depending on the phase of infection. Primary infection (Acute HIV) Most people infected by HIV develop a flu-like illness within a month or two after the virus enters the body. This illness, known as primary or acute HIV infection, may last for a few weeks. Possible signs and symptoms include: - Fever - Headache - Muscle aches and joint pain - Rash - Sore throat and painful mouth sores - Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck These symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream (viral load) is quite high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads more easily during primary infection than during the next stage. Clinical latent infection (Chronic HIV) In some people, persistent swelling of lymph nodes occurs during this stage. Otherwise, there are no specific signs and symptoms. HIV remains in the body and in infected white blood cells. This stage of HIV infection generally lasts around 10 years if you&apos;re not receiving antiretroviral therapy. But sometimes, even with this treatment, it lasts for decades. Some people develop more severe disease much sooner. Symptomatic HIV infection As the virus continues to multiply and destroy your immune cells - the cells in your body that help fight off germs - you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as: - Fever - Fatigue - Swollen lymph nodes - often one of the first signs of HIV infection - Diarrhea - Weight loss - Oral yeast infection (thrush) - Shingles (herpes zoster) Progression to AIDS Thanks to better antiviral treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today don&apos;t develop AIDS. Untreated, HIV typically turns into AIDS in about 10 years. When AIDS occurs, your immune system has been severely damaged. You&apos;ll be more likely to develop opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers - diseases that wouldn&apos;t usually trouble a person with a healthy immune system. The signs and symptoms of some of these infections may include: - Soaking night sweats - Recurring fever - Chronic diarrhea - Persistent white spots or unusual lesions on your tongue or in your mouth - Persistent, unexplained fatigue - Weight loss - Skin rashes or bumps When to see a doctor If you think you may have been infected with HIV or are at risk of contracting the virus, see a health care provider as soon as possible. HIV is caused by a virus. It can spread through sexual contact or blood, or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding. How does HIV become AIDS? HIV destroys CD4 T cells - white blood cells that play a large role in helping your body fight disease. The fewer CD4 T cells you have, the weaker your immune system becomes. You can have an HIV infection for years before it turns into AIDS. AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 T cell count falls below 200 or you have an AIDS-defining complication. How HIV spreads To become infected with HIV, infected blood, semen or vaginal secretions must enter your body. This can happen in several ways: - By having sex. You may become infected if you have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected partner whose blood, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body. The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that sometimes develop in the rectum or vagina during sexual activity. - From blood transfusions. In some cases, the virus may be transmitted through blood transfusions. American hospitals and blood banks now screen the blood supply for HIV antibodies, so this risk is very small. - By sharing needles. Sharing contaminated intravenous drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) puts you at high risk of HIV and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis. - During pregnancy or delivery or through breast-feeding. Infected mothers can pass the virus on to their babies. HIV-positive mothers who get treatment for the infection during pregnancy can significantly lower the risk to their babies. How HIV doesn&apos;t spread You can&apos;t become infected with HIV through ordinary contact. That means you can&apos;t catch HIV or AIDS by hugging, kissing, dancing or shaking hands with someone who has the infection. HIV isn&apos;t spread through the air, water or insect bites. When HIV/AIDS first appeared in the United States, it mainly affected men who had sex with men. However, now it&apos;s clear that HIV also spreads through heterosexual sex. Anyone of any age, race, sex or sexual orientation can be infected. However, you&apos;re at greatest risk of HIV/AIDS if you: - Have unprotected sex. Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex. Anal sex is more risky than is vaginal sex. Your risk of HIV increases if you have multiple sexual partners. - Have an STI. Many STIs produce open sores on your genitals. These sores act as doorways for HIV to enter your body. - Use intravenous drugs. People who use intravenous drugs often share needles and syringes. This exposes them to droplets of other people&apos;s blood. - Are an uncircumcised man. Studies suggest that lack of circumcision increases the risk of heterosexual transmission of HIV. HIV infection weakens your immune system, making you much more likely to develop numerous infections and certain types of cancers. Infections common to HIV/AIDS - Tuberculosis (TB). In resource-limited nations, TB is the most common opportunistic infection associated with HIV. It&apos;s a leading cause of death among people with AIDS. - Cytomegalovirus. This common herpes virus is transmitted in body fluids such as saliva, blood, urine, semen and breast milk. A healthy immune system inactivates the virus, and it remains dormant in your body. If your immune system weakens, the virus resurfaces - causing damage to your eyes, digestive tract, lungs or other organs. - Candidiasis. Candidiasis is a common HIV-related infection. It causes inflammation and a thick, white coating on the mucous membranes of your mouth, tongue, esophagus or vagina. - Cryptococcal meningitis. Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord (meninges). Cryptococcal meningitis is a common central nervous system infection associated with HIV, caused by a fungus found in soil. - Toxoplasmosis. This potentially deadly infection is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite spread primarily by cats. Infected cats pass the parasites in their stools, which may then spread to other animals and humans. Seizures occur when it spreads to the brain. - Cryptosporidiosis. This infection is caused by an intestinal parasite that&apos;s commonly found in animals. You get it when you eat or drink contaminated food or water. The parasite grows in your intestines and bile ducts, leading to severe, chronic diarrhea in people with AIDS. Cancers common to HIV/AIDS - Kaposi&apos;s sarcoma. A tumor of the blood vessel walls, this cancer is rare in people not infected with HIV, but common in HIV-positive people. It usually appears as pink, red or purple lesions on the skin and mouth. In people with darker skin, the lesions may look dark brown or black. Kaposi&apos;s sarcoma can also affect the internal organs, including the digestive tract and lungs. - Lymphoma. This cancer starts in the white blood cells. The most common early sign is painless swelling of the lymph nodes in your neck, armpit or groin. Other complications - Wasting syndrome. Aggressive treatment approaches have reduced the number of cases of wasting syndrome, but it still affects many people with AIDS. It&apos;s defined as a loss of at least 10 percent of body weight, often accompanied by diarrhea, chronic weakness and fever. - Neurological complications. Although AIDS doesn&apos;t appear to infect the nerve cells, it can cause neurological symptoms such as confusion, forgetfulness, depression, anxiety and difficulty walking. One of the most common neurological complications is AIDS dementia complex, which leads to behavioral changes and reduced mental functioning. - Kidney disease. HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is an inflammation of the tiny filters in your kidneys that remove excess fluid and wastes from your blood and pass them to your urine. It most often affects blacks or Hispanics. Anyone with this complication should be started on antiretroviral therapy. HIV is most commonly diagnosed by testing your blood or saliva for antibodies to the virus. Unfortunately, it takes time for your body to develop these antibodies - usually up to 12 weeks. A quicker test checks for HIV antigen, a protein produced by the virus immediately after infection. It can confirm a diagnosis soon after infection and allow the person to take swifter steps to prevent the spread of the virus to others. Home testing At least two Food and Drug Administration-approved home test kits for HIV are available. Depending on which you choose, you&apos;ll need a drop of dried blood or sample of saliva. If the test is positive, you&apos;ll need to see your doctor to confirm the diagnosis and discuss your treatment options. If the test is negative, it needs to be repeated in a few months to confirm the results. Tests to stage disease and treatment If you receive a diagnosis of HIV/AIDS, several tests can help your doctor determine the stage of your disease and the best treatment. These tests include: - CD4 T cell count. CD4 T cells are white blood cells that are specifically targeted and destroyed by HIV. Even if you have no symptoms, HIV infection progresses to AIDS when your CD4 T cell count dips below 200. - Viral load (HIV RNA). This test measures the amount of virus in your blood. A higher viral load has been linked to a worse outcome. - Drug resistance. Some strains of HIV are resistant to medications. This test helps your doctor determine if your specific form of the virus has resistance and guides treatment decisions. Tests for complications Your doctor might also order lab tests to check for other infections or complications, including: - Tuberculosis - Hepatitis - Toxoplasmosis - Sexually transmitted infections - Liver or kidney damage - Urinary tract infection There&apos;s no cure for HIV/AIDS, but many different drugs are available to control the virus. Such treatment is called antiretroviral therapy, or ART. Each class of drug blocks the virus in different ways. ART is now recommended for everyone, regardless of CD4 T cell counts. It&apos;s recommended to combine three drugs from two classes to avoid creating drug-resistant strains of HIV. The classes of anti-HIV drugs include: - Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) turn off a protein needed by HIV to make copies of itself. Examples include efavirenz (Sustiva), etravirine (Intelence) and nevirapine (Viramune). - Nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are faulty versions of the building blocks that HIV needs to make copies of itself. Examples include Abacavir (Ziagen), and the combination drugs emtricitabine/tenofovir (Truvada), Descovy (tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine), and lamivudine-zidovudine (Combivir). - Protease inhibitors (PIs) inactivate HIV protease, another protein that HIV needs to make copies of itself. Examples include atazanavir (Reyataz), darunavir (Prezista), fosamprenavir (Lexiva) and indinavir (Crixivan). - Entry or fusion inhibitors Tblock HIV&apos;s entry into CD4 T cells. Examples include enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) and maraviroc (Selzentry). - Integrase inhibitors work by disabling a protein called integrase, which HIV uses to insert its genetic material into CD4 T cells. Examples include raltegravir (Isentress) and dolutegravir (Tivicay). When to start treatment Everyone with HIV infection, regardless of CD4 T cell count, should be offered antiviral medication. HIV therapy is particularly important for the following situations: - You have severe symptoms. - You have an opportunistic infection. - Your CD4 T cell count is under 350. - You&apos;re pregnant. - You have HIV-related kidney disease. - You&apos;re being treated for hepatitis B or C. Treatment can be difficult HIV treatment plans may involve taking several pills at specific times every day for the rest of your life. Each medication comes with its own unique set of side effects. It&apos;s critical to have regular follow-up appointments with your doctor to monitor your health and treatment. Some of the treatment side effects are: - Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea - Heart disease - Weakened bones or bone loss - Breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis) - Abnormal cholesterol levels - Higher blood sugar Treatment for age-related diseases Some health issues that are a natural part of aging may be more difficult to manage if you have HIV. Some medications that are common for age-related heart, bone or metabolic conditions, for example, may not interact well with anti-HIV medications. It&apos;s important to talk to your doctor about your other health conditions and the medications you are taking. Treatment response Your doctor will monitor your viral load and CD4 T cell counts to determine your response to HIV treatment. CD4 T cell counts should be checked every three to six months. Viral load should be tested at the start of treatment and then every three to four months during therapy. Treatment should lower your viral load so that it&apos;s undetectable. That doesn&apos;t mean your HIV is gone. It just means that the test isn&apos;t sensitive enough to detect it. Along with receiving medical treatment, it&apos;s essential to take an active role in your own care. The following suggestions may help you stay healthy longer: - Eat healthy foods. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein help keep you strong, give you more energy and support your immune system. - Avoid raw meat, eggs and more. Foodborne illnesses can be especially severe in people who are infected with HIV. Cook meat until it&apos;s well-done. Avoid unpasteurized dairy products, raw eggs and raw seafood such as oysters, sushi or sashimi. - Get the right immunizations. These may prevent infections such as pneumonia and the flu. Make sure the vaccines don&apos;t contain live viruses, which can be dangerous for people with weakened immune systems. - Take care with companion animals. Some animals may carry parasites that can cause infections in people who are HIV-positive. Cat feces can cause toxoplasmosis, reptiles can carry salmonella, and birds can carry cryptococcus or histoplasmosis. Wash hands thoroughly after handling pets or emptying the litter box. People who are infected with HIV sometimes try dietary supplements that claim to boost the immune system or counteract side effects of anti-HIV drugs. However, there is no scientific evidence that any nutritional supplement improves immunity, and many may interfere with other medications you are taking. Supplements that may be helpful - Acetyl-L-carnitine. Researchers have used acetyl-L-carnitine to treat nerve pain in people with diabetes. It may also ease nerve pain linked to HIV if you&apos;re lacking in the substance. - Whey protein. Early evidence suggests that whey protein, a cheese byproduct, can help some people with HIV gain weight. Whey protein also appears to reduce diarrhea and increase CD4 T cell counts. Supplements that may be dangerous - St. John&apos;s wort. A common depression remedy, St. John&apos;s wort can reduce the effectiveness of several types of anti-HIV drugs by more than half. - Garlic supplements. Although garlic itself may help strengthen the immune system, garlic supplements interact with several anti-HIV drugs and reduce their ability to work. Occasionally eating garlic in food appears to be safe. Be sure to discuss the use of any dietary supplement with your doctor before trying it to ensure that it won&apos;t adversely interact with any of your medications.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>HIV/AIDS: Much of the communication between doctor and patient is personal. To have a good partnership with your doctor, it is important to talk about sensitive subjects, like sex or memory problems, even if you are embarrassed or uncomfortable. Most doctors are used to talking about personal matters and will try to ease your discomfort. Keep in mind that these topics concern many older people. You can use booklets and other materials from NIA or the organizations listed at the end of the article to help you bring up sensitive subjects when talking with your doctor.It is important to understand that problems with memory, depression, sexual function, and incontinence are not necessarily normal parts of aging. A good doctor will take your concerns about these topics seriously and not brush them off. If you think your doctor isn&apos;t taking your concerns seriously, talk to him or her about your feelings or consider looking for a new doctor. Read on for examples of ways to bring up these subjects during your appointment. Much of the communication between doctor and patient is personal.

Alcohol can have a greater effect as a person grows older because the aging process affects how the body handles alcohol. People can also develop a drinking problem later in life due to major life changes like the death of loved ones. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be developing a drinking problem. You could say: &quot;Lately, I&apos;ve been wanting to have a drink earlier and earlier in the afternoon, and I find it&apos;s getting harder to stop after just one or two. What kind of treatments could help with this?&quot;Learn more about alcohol and older adults. A fall can be a serious event, often leading to injury and loss of independence, at least for a while. For this reason, many older people develop a fear of falling. Studies show that fear of falling can keep people from going about their normal activities and, as a result, they may become frailer, which actually increases their risk of falling again. If fear of falling is affecting your day-to-day life, let your doctor know. He or she may be able to recommend some things to do to reduce your chances of falling. Exercises can help you improve your balance and strengthen your muscles, at any age. Read about how to prevent falls and fractures.Regular exercise makes you stronger and can help you prevent falls. NIA&apos;s exercise and physical activity campaign, Go4Life, was designed for older adults and can help you fit exercise and physical activity into your daily life. Share this infographic to spread the word about ways older adults can get the most out of their medical visits.Misunderstandings can come up in any relationship, including between a patient and doctor or the doctor&apos;s staff. If you feel uncomfortable with something your doctor or his or her staff has said or done, be direct. For example, if the doctor does not return your telephone calls, you may want to say something like this: &quot;I realize that you care for a lot of patients and are very busy, but I feel frustrated when I have to wait for days for you to return my call. Is there a way we can work together to improve this?&quot;Being honest is much better for your health than avoiding the doctor. If you have a long-standing relationship with your doctor, working out the problem may be more useful than looking for a new doctor. As people grow older, they may lose significant people in their lives, including spouses and cherished friends. Or, they may have to move away from home or give up favorite activities. A doctor who knows about your losses is better able to understand how you are feeling. He or she can make suggestions that may be helpful to you.There is no right or wrong way to grieve. Read how you can take care of yourself while you are mourning the death of a spouse.Although it is normal to mourn when you have a loss, later life does not have to be a time of ongoing sadness. If you feel sad all the time or for more than a few weeks, let your doctor know. Also, tell your doctor about symptoms such as lack of energy, poor appetite, trouble sleeping, or little interest in life. These could be signs of depression, which is a medical condition.Depression is a common problem among older adults, but it is NOT a normal part of aging. Depression may be common, especially when people experience losses, but it is also treatable. It should not be considered normal at any age. Let your doctor know about your feelings and ask about treatment.Read more about depression in older adults. After divorce, separation, or the death of a spouse, some older people may find themselves dating again, and possibly having sex with a new partner. It&apos;s a good idea to talk with your doctor about how safe sex can reduce your risk of sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS. It&apos;s important to practice safe sex, no matter what your age. Older people sometimes have problems controlling their bladder. This is called urinary incontinence and it can often be treated. If you have trouble controlling your bladder or bowels, it is important to let the doctor know. To bring up the topic, you could say something like: &quot;Since my last visit there have been several times when I couldn&apos;t control my bladder.&quot;Learn more about bladder health. Many older people worry about their ability to think and remember. For most older adults, thinking and memory remain relatively intact in later years. However, if you or your family notice that you are having problems remembering recent events or thinking clearly, let your doctor know. Be specific about the changes you&apos;ve noticed. For example, you could say: &quot;I&apos;ve always been able to balance my checkbook without any problems, but lately I&apos;m very confused.&quot; Your doctor will probably want you to have a thorough checkup to see what might be causing your symptoms.Free Information If you are worried about memory problems and Alzheimer&apos;s disease, you can contact the Alzheimer&apos;s and related Dementias Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center, a service of the National Institute on Aging. ADEAR staff can: - Answer specific questions about Alzheimer&apos;s - Send free publications - Refer callers to local resources - Provide information about clinical trials - Help you find materials about specific issues Call toll-free 1-800-438-4380 or read about Alzheimer&apos;s and related dementias online. Even strong and loving families can have problems, especially under the stress of illness. Although family problems can be painful to discuss, talking about them can help your doctor help you.If you feel that a family member or caregiver is taking advantage of you or mistreating you, let your doctor know. Some older people are abused by family members or others. Abuse can be physical, verbal, emotional, or even financial in nature. Your doctor may be able to provide resources or referrals to other services that can help if you are being mistreated.Learn more about how to recognize elder abuse. Most health professionals now understand that sexuality remains important in later life. If you are not satisfied with your sex life, don&apos;t just assume it&apos;s due to your age. In addition to talking about age-related changes, you can ask your doctor about the effects of an illness or a disability on sexual function. Also, ask your doctor about the influence medications or surgery may have on your sex life.If you aren&apos;t sure how to bring the topic up, try saying: &quot;I have a personal question I would like to ask you...&quot; or &quot;I understand that this condition or medication can affect my body in many ways. Will it affect my sex life at all?&quot;Learn more about how growing older might affect your sex life. Like most people, you probably have heard a lot about HIV and AIDS. You may have thought that these diseases aren&apos;t your problem and that only younger people have to worry about them. But, anyone at any age can be infected with HIV. Like most people, you probably have heard a lot about HIV and AIDS. You may have thought that these diseases aren&apos;t your problem and that only younger people have to worry about them. But, anyone at any age can be infected with HIV. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that damages and weakens the body&apos;s immune system-the system your body uses to fight off infection and disease. Having HIV puts a person in danger of experiencing other life-threatening infections and certain cancers.When the body cannot fight off infections and some other diseases anymore, HIV can lead to a serious illness called AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). When someone has AIDS, they are more likely to get infections, and more vulnerable to unusual forms of cancers and other serious diseases. But, with early and uninterrupted treatment, it is possible that a person with HIV will never develop AIDS.If you think you may have HIV, you should get tested. Everyone age 13 to 64 should be tested at least once for HIV. If you are over 64 and are at risk for HIV, talk with your doctor. Your doctor can help determine how often you should be tested and help find ways to reduce your risk.There are drugs that, when taken consistently, can help suppress the amount of HIV in your blood to undetectable levels, improving your health overall and making it harder to pass HIV on to your sexual partners. To get the best results, it is important to start treatment as soon as possible. If you are unsure about your HIV status, get tested. Always protect yourself and your partners when having sex or using needles. A small blood sample, mouth swab, or urine sample is used to test people for HIV. It can take as long as 3 to 6 months after initial exposure for the signs of the virus to show up in your blood, and years before you show any symptoms.You can be tested at a doctor&apos;s office, hospital, community health center, or other health clinic. Some places have mobile testing vans. AIDS services organizations also may provide testing. At-home testing kits are also available.Depending on where you go, testing may be free. You may be able to choose to take the test without giving your name. Many providers or groups that offer HIV testing also provide counseling.If you choose to take a test at home, make sure to use a test that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If the test has not been approved by the FDA, it may not give accurate results. Home tests are sold at drugstores and online. Follow up with your doctor to confirm the results of at-home tests and, if necessary, begin treatment.Finding a Place to Get Tested for HIV Your doctor or other healthcare provider can test you for HIV or tell you where you can get tested. Or, the following resources can help you find a testing location: - HIV Testing and Care Locator - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or call 1-800-232-4636 (toll-free). - Your local health department Drugstores also sell home testing kits (such as the Home Access HIV-1 Test System or the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test). Anyone, at any age, can get HIV. People usually acquire HIV from unprotected sex with someone living with HIV, through contact with HIV-infected blood, or by sharing needles with a person living with HIV. You may be at risk if:- You had sex without a latex or polyurethane condom. The virus passes from the person living with HIV to his or her partner via blood, semen, or vaginal fluid. During sex, HIV can get into your body through body fluids and any opening, such as a tear or cut in the lining of the vagina, vulva, penis, rectum, or-rarely-the mouth. Latex condoms can help prevent HIV transmission between sexual partners. (Natural condoms, like condoms made from lambskin, are not as effective as latex and polyurethane condoms at protecting against HIV/AIDS.) - You or your sexual partners have shared needles with a person living with HIV. People who inject illegal drugs are not the only people who might share needles. For example, people with diabetes who inject insulin or draw blood to test glucose levels could also share needles. Talk to your partner(s) about their drug and sexual history, and always use a new, sterile needle for injections. - You had a blood transfusion or operation in a developing country at any time. - You had a blood transfusion in the United States between 1978 and 1985. - You were diagnosed with or treated for hepatitis or tuberculosis (TB) at any time.Talk to Your Partner(s) About Their Drug and Sexual History Learning more about HIV risks can help you stay healthy. Even though it may be hard to do, ask your partner about his or her sexual history and whether he or she has ever shared needles. You might ask: Have you been tested for HIV? Have you ever had unprotected sex? Have you injected drugs or shared needles with someone else? Many people do not notice symptoms when they first acquire HIV. It can take as little as a few weeks for minor, flu-like symptoms to show up, or more than 10 years for more serious symptoms to appear, or any time in between. Signs of early HIV infection include flu-like symptoms such as headache, muscle aches, swollen glands, sore throat, fevers, chills, and sweating, and can also include a rash or mouth ulcers. Symptoms of later-stage HIV or AIDS include swollen glands, lack of energy, loss of appetite, weight loss, chronic or recurrent diarrhea, repeated yeast infections, short-term memory loss, and blotchy lesions on the skin, inside the mouth, eyelids, nose, or genital area. A growing number of older people are living with HIV/AIDS. One reason is because improved treatments are helping people with the disease live longer. Nearly half of people living with HIV in the United States are age 50 and older. Many of them were diagnosed with HIV in their younger years. However, thousands of older people get HIV every year.Older people are less likely than younger people to get tested, so they may not know they have HIV. Signs of HIV/AIDS can be mistaken for the aches and pains of normal aging. Older adults might be coping with other diseases and the aches and pains of normal aging that can mask the signs of HIV/AIDS.Some older people may feel ashamed or afraid of being tested. Plus, doctors do not always think to test older people for HIV. By the time the older person is diagnosed, the virus may be in the late stages and more likely to progress to AIDS.Remember, if you are at risk, get tested regularly for HIV.For people who have HIV, it is important to start treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis. Treatment can help reduce the level of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels. When treatment makes HIV undetectable, the possibility of spreading the virus to a sexual partner becomes very low. This is known as treatment as prevention (TasP).Even when the disease is well controlled, people with HIV may develop aging-related conditions at a younger age. HIV and its treatment can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain and the heart. For example, people living with HIV are significantly more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than people without HIV. Older people living with HIV also have an increased risk of dementia. Talk with your doctor if you are concerned about how living with HIV could affect you as you grow older.Facts About HIV/AIDS You may have read or heard things that are not true about how you get HIV. Here are the facts: - You cannot get HIV through casual contact, such as shaking hands or hugging a person with HIV/AIDS. - You cannot get HIV from using a public telephone, drinking fountain, restroom, swimming pool, whirlpool, or hot tub. - You cannot get HIV from sharing a drink. - You cannot get HIV from being coughed or sneezed on by a person with HIV/AIDS. - You cannot get HIV from giving blood. - You cannot get HIV from a mosquito bite. There is no cure for HIV. But if you acquire the virus, there are drugs that help suppress the level of HIV in the body and prevent its spread to other people. Doctors use a combination of drugs called HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) to treat HIV/AIDS. Although it is not a cure, HAART has greatly reduced the number of deaths from HIV-related complications in the United States. HIV has become like a chronic disease, and people living with HIV receiving successful treatment can live a long and healthy life. Remember, there are things you can do to keep from getting or transmitting HIV. Take the following steps to lower your risk:- If you are having sex, consider limiting your number of sexual partners. If you or your partner is having sex with other people, or if you don&apos;t know his or her sexual or drug history, always use protection. The more partners you have, the more likely you are to be exposed to a sexually transmitted infection. - Before having sex with someone, talk with them about HIV. Ask about their sexual and drug history. Get tested for sexually transmitted infections every year. - Learn about the risks of different sexual activities and reduce your risk. (See the CDC&apos;s HIV Risk Reduction Tool for information about the risk associated with specific sexual behaviors.) - Use male or female condoms (latex or polyurethane) during sexual intercourse. - Do not share needles or any other equipment used to inject drugs. Always use new, sterile needles for injection. - Get tested if you or your partner has had an operation or blood transfusion in a developing country at any time. - Get tested if you or your partner had a blood transfusion between 1978 and 1985 in the United States.If you are at very high risk for HIV infection through sex or injection drug use, you may prevent it by taking an anti-HIV medication daily, called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. PrEP is effective at reducing the risk of acquiring HIV, but it must be taken every day. Talk with your doctor to find out whether PreP is right for you.Read about this topic in Spanish.

With aging, that may mean adapting sexual activity to accommodate physical, health, and other changes.There are many different ways to have sex and be intimate-alone or with a partner. The expression of your sexuality could include many types of touch or stimulation. Some adults may choose not to engage in sexual activity, and that&apos;s also normal.Here, we explore some of the common problems older adults may face with sex. Many people want and need to be close to others as they grow older. For some, this includes the desire to continue an active, satisfying sex life. With aging, that may mean adapting sexual activity to accommodate physical, health, and other changes.There are many different ways to have sex and be intimate-alone or with a partner. The expression of your sexuality could include many types of touch or stimulation. Some adults may choose not to engage in sexual activity, and that&apos;s also normal.Here, we explore some of the common problems older adults may face with sex. Normal aging brings physical changes in both men and women. These changes sometimes affect the ability to have and enjoy sex.A woman may notice changes in her vagina. As a woman ages, her vagina can shorten and narrow. Her vaginal walls can become thinner and a little stiffer. Most women will have less vaginal lubrication, and it may take more time for the vagina to naturally lubricate itself. These changes could make certain types of sexual activity, such as vaginal penetration, painful or less desirable. If vaginal dryness is an issue, using water-based lubricating jelly or lubricated condoms may be more comfortable. If a woman is using hormone therapy to treat hot flashes or other menopausal symptoms, she may want to have sex more often than she did before hormone therapy.As men get older, impotence (also called erectile dysfunction, or ED) becomes more common. ED is the loss of ability to have and keep an erection. ED may cause a man to take longer to have an erection. His erection may not be as firm or as large as it used to be. The loss of erection after orgasm may happen more quickly, or it may take longer before another erection is possible. ED is not a problem if it happens every now and then, but if it occurs often, talk with your doctor.Talk with your partner about these changes and how you are feeling. Your doctor may have suggestions to help make sex easier. Some illnesses, disabilities, medicines, and surgeries can affect your ability to have and enjoy sex.Arthritis. Joint pain due to arthritis can make sexual contact uncomfortable. Exercise, drugs, and possibly joint replacement surgery may help relieve this pain. Rest, warm baths, and changing the position or timing of sexual activity can be helpful.Chronic pain. Pain can interfere with intimacy between older people. Chronic pain does not have to be part of growing older and can often be treated. But, some pain medicines can interfere with sexual function. Always talk with your doctor if you have side effects from any medication.Dementia. Some people with dementia show increased interest in sex and physical closeness, but they may not be able to judge what is appropriate sexual behavior. Those with severe dementia may not recognize their spouse or partner, but they still desire sexual contact and may seek it with someone else. It can be confusing and difficult to know how to handle this situation. Here, too, talking with a doctor, nurse, or social worker with training in dementia care may be helpful.Diabetes. This is one of the illnesses that can cause ED in some men. In most cases, medical treatment can help. Less is known about how diabetes affects sexuality in older women. Women with diabetes are more likely to have vaginal yeast infections, which can cause itching and irritation and make sex uncomfortable or undesirable. Yeast infections can be treated.Heart disease. Narrowing and hardening of the arteries can change blood vessels so that blood does not flow freely. As a result, men and women may have problems with orgasms. For both men and women, it may take longer to become aroused, and for some men, it may be difficult to have or maintain an erection. People who have had a heart attack, or their partners, may be afraid that having sex will cause another attack. Even though sexual activity is generally safe, always follow your doctor&apos;s advice. If your heart problems get worse and you have chest pain or shortness of breath even while resting, your doctor may want to change your treatment plan.Incontinence. Loss of bladder control or leaking of urine is more common as people, especially women, grow older. Extra pressure on the belly during sex can cause loss of urine. This can be helped by changing positions or by emptying the bladder before and after sex. The good news is that incontinence can usually be treated.Stroke. The ability to have sex is sometimes affected by a stroke. A change in positions or medical devices may help people with ongoing weakness or paralysis to have sex. Some people with paralysis from the waist down are still able to experience orgasm and pleasure.Depression. Lack of interest in activities you used to enjoy, such as intimacy and sexual activity, can be a symptom of depression. It&apos;s sometimes hard to know if you&apos;re depressed. Talk with your doctor. Depression can be treated.Surgery. Many of us worry about having any kind of surgery-it may be even more troubling when the breasts or genital area are involved. Most people do return to the kind of sex life they enjoyed before surgery.Hysterectomy is surgery to remove a woman&apos;s uterus because of pain, bleeding, fibroids, or other reasons. Often, when an older woman has a hysterectomy, the ovaries are also removed. Deciding whether to have this surgery can leave both women and their partners worried about their future sex life. If you&apos;re concerned about any changes you might experience with a hysterectomy, talk with your gynecologist or surgeon.Mastectomy is surgery to remove all or part of a woman&apos;s breast because of breast cancer. This surgery may cause some women to lose their sexual interest, or it may leave them feeling less desirable or attractive to their partners. In addition to talking with your doctor, sometimes it is useful to talk with other women who have had this surgery. Programs like the American Cancer Society&apos;s &quot;Reach to Recovery&quot; can be helpful for both women and men. If you want your breast rebuilt (reconstruction), talk to your cancer doctor or surgeon.Prostatectomy is surgery that removes all or part of a man&apos;s prostate because of cancer or an enlarged prostate. It may cause urinary incontinence or ED. If you need this operation, talk with your doctor before surgery about your concerns.Medications. Some drugs can cause sexual problems. These include some blood pressure medicines, antihistamines, antidepressants, tranquilizers, Parkinson&apos;s disease or cancer medications, appetite suppressants, drugs for mental problems, and ulcer drugs. Some can lead to ED or make it hard for men to ejaculate. Some drugs can reduce a woman&apos;s sexual desire or cause vaginal dryness or difficulty with arousal and orgasm. Check with your doctor to see if there is a different drug without this side effect.Alcohol. Too much alcohol can cause erection problems in men and delay orgasm in women. Age does not protect you from sexually transmitted diseases. Older people who are sexually active may be at risk for diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, genital herpes, hepatitis B, genital warts, and trichomoniasis.Almost anyone who is sexually active is also at risk of being infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. The number of older people with HIV/AIDS is growing. You are at risk for HIV/AIDS if you or your partner has more than one sexual partner, if you are having unprotected sex, or if either you or your partner is sharing needles. To protect yourself, always use a condom during sex that involves vaginal or anal penetration.A man needs to have a full erection before putting on a condom.Talk with your doctor about ways to protect yourself from all sexually transmitted diseases and infections. Go for regular checkups and testing. Talk with your partner. You are never too old to be at risk. Sexuality is often a delicate balance of emotional and physical issues. How you feel may affect what you are able to do and what you want to do. Many older couples find greater satisfaction in their sex lives than they did when they were younger. In many cases, they have fewer distractions, more time and privacy, no worries about getting pregnant, and greater intimacy with a lifelong partner.As we age, our bodies change, including our weight, skin, and muscle tone, and some older adults don&apos;t feel as comfortable in their aging bodies. Older adults, men and women alike, may worry that their partners will no longer find them attractive. Aging-related sexual problems like the ones listed above can cause stress and worry. This worry can get in the way of enjoying a fulfilling sex life.Older couples face the same daily stresses that affect people of any age. They may also have the added concerns of illness, retirement, and lifestyle changes, all of which may lead to sexual difficulties. Talk openly with your partner, and try not to blame yourself or your partner. You may also find it helpful to talk with a therapist, either alone or with your partner. Some therapists have special training in helping with sexual problems. If you sense changes in your partner&apos;s attitude toward sex, don&apos;t assume they are no longer interested in you or in an active sex life. Talk about it. Many of the things that cause sexual problems in older adults can be helped. There are things you can do on your own for an active and enjoyable sex life. If you have a long-term partner, take time to enjoy each other and to understand the changes you both are facing.Don&apos;t be afraid to talk with your doctor if you have a problem that affects your sex life. He or she may be able to suggest a treatment. For example, the most common sexual difficulty of older women is painful intercourse caused by vaginal dryness. Your doctor or a pharmacist can suggest over-the-counter vaginal lubricants or moisturizers to use. Water-based lubricants are helpful when needed to make sex more comfortable. Moisturizers are used on a regular basis, every 2 or 3 days. Or, your doctor might suggest a form of vaginal estrogen.If ED is the problem, it can often be managed and perhaps even reversed with medication or other treatments. There are pills that can help. They should not be used by men taking medicines containing nitrates, such as nitroglycerin. The pills do have possible side effects. Be wary of any dietary or herbal supplements promising to treat ED. Always talk to your doctor before taking any herb or supplement.Physical problems can change your sex life as you get older. If you are single, dating and meeting new people may be easier later in life when you&apos;re more sure of yourself and what you want. If you&apos;re in a relationship, you and your partner may discover new ways to be together as you get older. Talk to your partner or partners about your needs. You may find that affection-hugging, kissing, touching, and spending time together-can be just what you need, or a path to greater intimacy and sex.Read about this topic in Spanish.

				<AnswerText>HIV/AIDS (What Is HIV? What Is AIDS?): HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that damages and weakens the body&apos;s immune system-the system your body uses to fight off infection and disease. Having HIV puts a person in danger of experiencing other life-threatening infections and certain cancers.When the body cannot fight off infections and some other diseases anymore, HIV can lead to a serious illness called AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). When someone has AIDS, they are more likely to get infections, and more vulnerable to unusual forms of cancers and other serious diseases. But, with early and uninterrupted treatment, it is possible that a person with HIV will never develop AIDS.If you think you may have HIV, you should get tested. Everyone age 13 to 64 should be tested at least once for HIV. If you are over 64 and are at risk for HIV, talk with your doctor. Your doctor can help determine how often you should be tested and help find ways to reduce your risk.There are drugs that, when taken consistently, can help suppress the amount of HIV in your blood to undetectable levels, improving your health overall and making it harder to pass HIV on to your sexual partners. To get the best results, it is important to start treatment as soon as possible. If you are unsure about your HIV status, get tested. Always protect yourself and your partners when having sex or using needles.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>HIV/AIDS (Overview): HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, is the virus that causes AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). HIV attacks the immune system by destroying CD4 positive (CD4+) T cells, a type of white blood cell that is vital to fighting off infection. The destruction of these cells leaves people living with HIV vulnerable to other infections, diseases and other complications. As the leading U.S. government institute for HIV/AIDS research, NIAID is committed to conducting the research necessary to successfully end the fight against HIV/AIDS. </AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What causes HIV/AIDS?: The virus is spread (transmitted) person-to-person in any of the following ways: - Through sexual contact - Through blood -- by blood transfusions (now extremely rare in the U.S.) or more often by needle sharing - From mother to child -- a pregnant woman can spread the virus to her fetus through their shared blood circulation, or a nursing mother can pass it to her baby through her breast milk The virus is NOT spread by: - Casual contact, such as hugging - Mosquitoes - Participating in sports - Touching items that were touched by a person infected with the virus HIV and blood or organ donation: - HIV is not spread to a person who donates blood or organs. People who donate organs are never in direct contact with the people who receive them. Likewise, a person who donates blood is never in contact with the person receiving it. In all of these procedures, sterile needles and instruments are used. - But HIV can be spread to a person receiving blood or organs from an infected donor. To reduce this risk, blood banks and organ donor programs check (screen) donors, blood, and tissues thoroughly. People at high risk of getting HIV include: - Drug users who inject and then share needles - Infants born to mothers with HIV who did not receive HIV treatment during pregnancy - People who have unprotected sex, especially with people who have other high-risk behaviors, are HIV-positive, or have AIDS - People who received blood transfusions or clotting products between 1977 and 1985, before screening for the virus became standard practice - Sexual partners of those who engage in high-risk activities (such as injection drug use or anal sex) After HIV infects the body, the virus can be found in many different fluids and tissues in the body. - Only blood, semen, fluids from the vagina, and breast milk have been shown to transmit infection to others. - The virus may also be found in saliva, tears, and spinal fluid.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>HIV/AIDS (Risk factors): When HIV/AIDS first appeared in the United States, it mainly affected men who had sex with men. However, now it&apos;s clear that HIV also spreads through heterosexual sex. Anyone of any age, race, sex or sexual orientation can be infected. However, you&apos;re at greatest risk of HIV/AIDS if you: - Have unprotected sex. Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex. Anal sex is more risky than is vaginal sex. Your risk of HIV increases if you have multiple sexual partners. - Have an STI. Many STIs produce open sores on your genitals. These sores act as doorways for HIV to enter your body. - Use intravenous drugs. People who use intravenous drugs often share needles and syringes. This exposes them to droplets of other people&apos;s blood. - Are an uncircumcised man. Studies suggest that lack of circumcision increases the risk of heterosexual transmission of HIV.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>HIV/AIDS (Symptoms): The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary, depending on the phase of infection. Primary infection (Acute HIV) Most people infected by HIV develop a flu-like illness within a month or two after the virus enters the body. This illness, known as primary or acute HIV infection, may last for a few weeks. Possible signs and symptoms include: - Fever - Headache - Muscle aches and joint pain - Rash - Sore throat and painful mouth sores - Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck These symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream (viral load) is quite high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads more easily during primary infection than during the next stage. Clinical latent infection (Chronic HIV) In some people, persistent swelling of lymph nodes occurs during this stage. Otherwise, there are no specific signs and symptoms. HIV remains in the body and in infected white blood cells. This stage of HIV infection generally lasts around 10 years if you&apos;re not receiving antiretroviral therapy. But sometimes, even with this treatment, it lasts for decades. Some people develop more severe disease much sooner. Symptomatic HIV infection As the virus continues to multiply and destroy your immune cells - the cells in your body that help fight off germs - you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as: - Fever - Fatigue - Swollen lymph nodes - often one of the first signs of HIV infection - Diarrhea - Weight loss - Oral yeast infection (thrush) - Shingles (herpes zoster) Progression to AIDS Thanks to better antiviral treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today don&apos;t develop AIDS. Untreated, HIV typically turns into AIDS in about 10 years. When AIDS occurs, your immune system has been severely damaged. You&apos;ll be more likely to develop opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers - diseases that wouldn&apos;t usually trouble a person with a healthy immune system. The signs and symptoms of some of these infections may include: - Soaking night sweats - Recurring fever - Chronic diarrhea - Persistent white spots or unusual lesions on your tongue or in your mouth - Persistent, unexplained fatigue - Weight loss - Skin rashes or bumps When to see a doctor If you think you may have been infected with HIV or are at risk of contracting the virus, see a health care provider as soon as possible.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What are the treatments for HIV/AIDS?: HIV/AIDS is treated with medicines that stop the virus from multiplying. This treatment is called antiretroviral therapy (ART). In the past, people with HIV infection would start antiretroviral treatment after their CD4 count dropped or they developed HIV complications. Today, HIV treatment is recommended for all people with HIV infection, even if their CD4 count is still normal. Regular blood tests are needed to make sure the virus level in the blood (viral load) is kept low, or suppressed. The goal of treatment is to lower the HIV virus in the blood to a level that is so low that the test can&apos;t detect it. This is called an undetectable viral load. If the CD4 count already dropped before treatment was started, it will usually slowly go up. HIV complications often disappear as the immune system recovers.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>HIV/AIDS (Treatment): There&apos;s no cure for HIV/AIDS, but many different drugs are available to control the virus. Such treatment is called antiretroviral therapy, or ART. Each class of drug blocks the virus in different ways. ART is now recommended for everyone, regardless of CD4 T cell counts. It&apos;s recommended to combine three drugs from two classes to avoid creating drug-resistant strains of HIV. The classes of anti-HIV drugs include: - Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) turn off a protein needed by HIV to make copies of itself. Examples include efavirenz (Sustiva), etravirine (Intelence) and nevirapine (Viramune). - Nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are faulty versions of the building blocks that HIV needs to make copies of itself. Examples include Abacavir (Ziagen), and the combination drugs emtricitabine/tenofovir (Truvada), Descovy (tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine), and lamivudine-zidovudine (Combivir). - Protease inhibitors (PIs) inactivate HIV protease, another protein that HIV needs to make copies of itself. Examples include atazanavir (Reyataz), darunavir (Prezista), fosamprenavir (Lexiva) and indinavir (Crixivan). - Entry or fusion inhibitors Tblock HIV&apos;s entry into CD4 T cells. Examples include enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) and maraviroc (Selzentry). - Integrase inhibitors work by disabling a protein called integrase, which HIV uses to insert its genetic material into CD4 T cells. Examples include raltegravir (Isentress) and dolutegravir (Tivicay). When to start treatment Everyone with HIV infection, regardless of CD4 T cell count, should be offered antiviral medication. HIV therapy is particularly important for the following situations: - You have severe symptoms. - You have an opportunistic infection. - Your CD4 T cell count is under 350. - You&apos;re pregnant. - You have HIV-related kidney disease. - You&apos;re being treated for hepatitis B or C. Treatment can be difficult HIV treatment plans may involve taking several pills at specific times every day for the rest of your life. Each medication comes with its own unique set of side effects. It&apos;s critical to have regular follow-up appointments with your doctor to monitor your health and treatment. Some of the treatment side effects are: - Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea - Heart disease - Weakened bones or bone loss - Breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis) - Abnormal cholesterol levels - Higher blood sugar Treatment for age-related diseases Some health issues that are a natural part of aging may be more difficult to manage if you have HIV. Some medications that are common for age-related heart, bone or metabolic conditions, for example, may not interact well with anti-HIV medications. It&apos;s important to talk to your doctor about your other health conditions and the medications you are taking. Treatment response Your doctor will monitor your viral load and CD4 T cell counts to determine your response to HIV treatment. CD4 T cell counts should be checked every three to six months. Viral load should be tested at the start of treatment and then every three to four months during therapy. Treatment should lower your viral load so that it&apos;s undetectable. That doesn&apos;t mean your HIV is gone. It just means that the test isn&apos;t sensitive enough to detect it.</AnswerText>

By the time the older person is diagnosed, the virus may be in the late stages and more likely to progress to AIDS.Remember, if you are at risk, get tested regularly for HIV.For people who have HIV, it is important to start treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis. Treatment can help reduce the level of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels. When treatment makes HIV undetectable, the possibility of spreading the virus to a sexual partner becomes very low. This is known as treatment as prevention (TasP).Even when the disease is well controlled, people with HIV may develop aging-related conditions at a younger age. HIV and its treatment can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain and the heart. For example, people living with HIV are significantly more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than people without HIV. Older people living with HIV also have an increased risk of dementia. Talk with your doctor if you are concerned about how living with HIV could affect you as you grow older.Facts About HIV/AIDS You may have read or heard things that are not true about how you get HIV. Here are the facts: - You cannot get HIV through casual contact, such as shaking hands or hugging a person with HIV/AIDS. - You cannot get HIV from using a public telephone, drinking fountain, restroom, swimming pool, whirlpool, or hot tub. - You cannot get HIV from sharing a drink. - You cannot get HIV from being coughed or sneezed on by a person with HIV/AIDS. - You cannot get HIV from giving blood. - You cannot get HIV from a mosquito bite.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>HIV/AIDS: HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, is the virus that causes AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). HIV attacks the immune system by destroying CD4 positive (CD4+) T cells, a type of white blood cell that is vital to fighting off infection. The destruction of these cells leaves people living with HIV vulnerable to other infections, diseases and other complications. As the leading U.S. government institute for HIV/AIDS research, NIAID is committed to conducting the research necessary to successfully end the fight against HIV/AIDS.  Nearly 37 million people are living with HIV around the world. In the United States, 1.2 million people are living with HIV, of whom 13 percent are unaware of their diagnosis. Although progress has been made in the global fight against HIV/AIDS, the epidemic continues in the United States and the international community. Globally, AIDS-related deaths have dropped by 45 percent since their peak in 2004. Yet the rate of HIV transmission remains unacceptably high, with 2.1 million new infections occurring worldwide in 2015 alone. NIAID-supported investigators are conducting an abundance of research on all areas of HIV infection, including developing and testing preventive HIV vaccines, prevention strategies, and new treatments for HIV infection and AIDS-associated opportunistic infections. Through laboratories and clinics on the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda, Maryland, and a vast network of supported research at universities, medical centers, and clinical trial sites around the globe, NIAID is working to better understand HIV and how it causes disease, find new tools to prevent HIV infection including a preventive vaccine, develop new and more effective treatments for people living with HIV, and hopefully, find a cure. Preventing new HIV infections is a key step toward ending the HIV pandemic as we know it. NIAID-supported researchers have worked since the early days of AIDS in the 1980s to identify prevention tools to keep people healthy. Today, an array of prevention methods are available for use in combination or on their own, and scientists continue to work to develop and improve cutting-edge tools and techniques that can work to prevent HIV in diverse populations around the world. Historically, vaccination has been the best method for protecting people from infectious diseases. While an array of techniques are available for preventing HIV infection, the development of a safe and effective HIV vaccine remains key to realizing a durable end to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. NIAID-supported scientists are working toward an HIV vaccine from two complementary angles: an empirical approach that quickly moves vaccine candidates into human testing, and a theoretical approach that designs vaccine candidates based on an understanding of the immune response to HIV infection. One of NIAID’s greatest success stories is that its research led to the development of numerous antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV/AIDS, turning what was once a uniformly fatal disease into a manageable chronic condition for many. NIAID is working to find new and more effective therapeutic products, drug classes, and combinations as well as safe and effective treatments for dangerous related co-infections and complications. NIAID is exploring therapies that suppress the amount of HIV to such low levels that an HIV-infected person would no longer need treatment because his or her immune system could keep the remaining virus in check, creating in essence a “functional cure.”</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>HIV/AIDS (Overview): Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By damaging your immune system, HIV interferes with your body&apos;s ability to fight the organisms that cause disease. HIV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It can also be spread by contact with infected blood or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding. Without medication, it may take years before HIV weakens your immune system to the point that you have AIDS. There&apos;s no cure for HIV/AIDS, but there are medications that can dramatically slow the progression of the disease. These drugs have reduced AIDS deaths in many developed nations.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>HIV/AIDS (Am I Too Old to Worry About Safe Sex?): Age does not protect you from sexually transmitted diseases. Older people who are sexually active may be at risk for diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, genital herpes, hepatitis B, genital warts, and trichomoniasis.Almost anyone who is sexually active is also at risk of being infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. The number of older people with HIV/AIDS is growing. You are at risk for HIV/AIDS if you or your partner has more than one sexual partner, if you are having unprotected sex, or if either you or your partner is sharing needles. To protect yourself, always use a condom during sex that involves vaginal or anal penetration.A man needs to have a full erection before putting on a condom.Talk with your doctor about ways to protect yourself from all sexually transmitted diseases and infections. Go for regular checkups and testing. Talk with your partner. You are never too old to be at risk.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>HIV/AIDS (Diagnosis): HIV is most commonly diagnosed by testing your blood or saliva for antibodies to the virus. Unfortunately, it takes time for your body to develop these antibodies - usually up to 12 weeks. A quicker test checks for HIV antigen, a protein produced by the virus immediately after infection. It can confirm a diagnosis soon after infection and allow the person to take swifter steps to prevent the spread of the virus to others. Home testing At least two Food and Drug Administration-approved home test kits for HIV are available. Depending on which you choose, you&apos;ll need a drop of dried blood or sample of saliva. If the test is positive, you&apos;ll need to see your doctor to confirm the diagnosis and discuss your treatment options. If the test is negative, it needs to be repeated in a few months to confirm the results. Tests to stage disease and treatment If you receive a diagnosis of HIV/AIDS, several tests can help your doctor determine the stage of your disease and the best treatment. These tests include: - CD4 T cell count. CD4 T cells are white blood cells that are specifically targeted and destroyed by HIV. Even if you have no symptoms, HIV infection progresses to AIDS when your CD4 T cell count dips below 200. - Viral load (HIV RNA). This test measures the amount of virus in your blood. A higher viral load has been linked to a worse outcome. - Drug resistance. Some strains of HIV are resistant to medications. This test helps your doctor determine if your specific form of the virus has resistance and guides treatment decisions. Tests for complications Your doctor might also order lab tests to check for other infections or complications, including: - Tuberculosis - Hepatitis - Toxoplasmosis - Sexually transmitted infections - Liver or kidney damage - Urinary tract infection</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>How to diagnose HIV/AIDS?: DIAGNOSTIC TESTS These are tests that are done to check if you&apos;ve been infected with the virus. In general, testing is a 2-step process: - Screening test -- There are several kinds of tests. Some are blood tests, others are mouth fluid tests. They check for antibodies to the HIV virus, HIV antigen, or both. Some screening tests can give results in 30 minutes or less. - Follow-up test -- This is also called a confirmatory test. It is often done when the screening test is positive. Home tests are available to test for HIV. If you plan to use one, checkto make sureit&apos;s approved by the FDA. Follow instructions on the packaging to ensure the results are as accurate as possible. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone ages 15 to 65 have a screening test for HIV. People with risky behaviors should be tested regularly. Pregnant women should also have a screening test. TESTS AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED WITH HIV People with AIDS usually have regular blood tests to check their CD4 cell count: - CD4 cells are the blood cells that HIV attacks. They are also called T4 cells or &quot;helper T cells.&quot; - As HIV damages the immune system, the CD4 count drops. A normal CD4 count is from 500 to 1,500 cells/mm3 of blood. - People usually develop symptoms when their CD4 count drops below 350. More serious complications occur when the CD4 count drops to 200. When the count is below 200, the person is said to have AIDS. Other tests include: - HIV RNA level, or viral load, to check how much HIV is in the blood - A resistance test to see if the virus has any resistance to the medicines used to treat HIV - Complete blood count, blood chemistry, and urine test - Tests for other sexually transmitted infections - TB test - Pap smear to check for cervical cancer - Anal pap smear to check for cancer of the anus</AnswerText>

Many of them were diagnosed with HIV in their younger years. However, thousands of older people get HIV every year.Older people are less likely than younger people to get tested, so they may not know they have HIV.

				<AnswerText>HIV/AIDS: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By damaging your immune system, HIV interferes with your body&apos;s ability to fight the organisms that cause disease. HIV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It can also be spread by contact with infected blood or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding. Without medication, it may take years before HIV weakens your immune system to the point that you have AIDS. There&apos;s no cure for HIV/AIDS, but there are medications that can dramatically slow the progression of the disease. These drugs have reduced AIDS deaths in many developed nations. The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary, depending on the phase of infection. Primary infection (Acute HIV) Most people infected by HIV develop a flu-like illness within a month or two after the virus enters the body. This illness, known as primary or acute HIV infection, may last for a few weeks. Possible signs and symptoms include: - Fever - Headache - Muscle aches and joint pain - Rash - Sore throat and painful mouth sores - Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck These symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream (viral load) is quite high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads more easily during primary infection than during the next stage. Clinical latent infection (Chronic HIV) In some people, persistent swelling of lymph nodes occurs during this stage. Otherwise, there are no specific signs and symptoms. HIV remains in the body and in infected white blood cells. This stage of HIV infection generally lasts around 10 years if you&apos;re not receiving antiretroviral therapy. But sometimes, even with this treatment, it lasts for decades. Some people develop more severe disease much sooner. Symptomatic HIV infection As the virus continues to multiply and destroy your immune cells - the cells in your body that help fight off germs - you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as: - Fever - Fatigue - Swollen lymph nodes - often one of the first signs of HIV infection - Diarrhea - Weight loss - Oral yeast infection (thrush) - Shingles (herpes zoster) Progression to AIDS Thanks to better antiviral treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today don&apos;t develop AIDS. Untreated, HIV typically turns into AIDS in about 10 years. When AIDS occurs, your immune system has been severely damaged. You&apos;ll be more likely to develop opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers - diseases that wouldn&apos;t usually trouble a person with a healthy immune system. The signs and symptoms of some of these infections may include: - Soaking night sweats - Recurring fever - Chronic diarrhea - Persistent white spots or unusual lesions on your tongue or in your mouth - Persistent, unexplained fatigue - Weight loss - Skin rashes or bumps When to see a doctor If you think you may have been infected with HIV or are at risk of contracting the virus, see a health care provider as soon as possible. HIV is caused by a virus. It can spread through sexual contact or blood, or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding. How does HIV become AIDS? HIV destroys CD4 T cells - white blood cells that play a large role in helping your body fight disease. The fewer CD4 T cells you have, the weaker your immune system becomes. You can have an HIV infection for years before it turns into AIDS. AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 T cell count falls below 200 or you have an AIDS-defining complication. How HIV spreads To become infected with HIV, infected blood, semen or vaginal secretions must enter your body. This can happen in several ways: - By having sex. You may become infected if you have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected partner whose blood, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body. The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that sometimes develop in the rectum or vagina during sexual activity. - From blood transfusions. In some cases, the virus may be transmitted through blood transfusions. American hospitals and blood banks now screen the blood supply for HIV antibodies, so this risk is very small. - By sharing needles. Sharing contaminated intravenous drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) puts you at high risk of HIV and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis. - During pregnancy or delivery or through breast-feeding. Infected mothers can pass the virus on to their babies. HIV-positive mothers who get treatment for the infection during pregnancy can significantly lower the risk to their babies. How HIV doesn&apos;t spread You can&apos;t become infected with HIV through ordinary contact. That means you can&apos;t catch HIV or AIDS by hugging, kissing, dancing or shaking hands with someone who has the infection. HIV isn&apos;t spread through the air, water or insect bites. When HIV/AIDS first appeared in the United States, it mainly affected men who had sex with men. However, now it&apos;s clear that HIV also spreads through heterosexual sex. Anyone of any age, race, sex or sexual orientation can be infected. However, you&apos;re at greatest risk of HIV/AIDS if you: - Have unprotected sex. Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex. Anal sex is more risky than is vaginal sex. Your risk of HIV increases if you have multiple sexual partners. - Have an STI. Many STIs produce open sores on your genitals. These sores act as doorways for HIV to enter your body. - Use intravenous drugs. People who use intravenous drugs often share needles and syringes. This exposes them to droplets of other people&apos;s blood. - Are an uncircumcised man. Studies suggest that lack of circumcision increases the risk of heterosexual transmission of HIV. HIV infection weakens your immune system, making you much more likely to develop numerous infections and certain types of cancers. Infections common to HIV/AIDS - Tuberculosis (TB). In resource-limited nations, TB is the most common opportunistic infection associated with HIV. It&apos;s a leading cause of death among people with AIDS. - Cytomegalovirus. This common herpes virus is transmitted in body fluids such as saliva, blood, urine, semen and breast milk. A healthy immune system inactivates the virus, and it remains dormant in your body. If your immune system weakens, the virus resurfaces - causing damage to your eyes, digestive tract, lungs or other organs. - Candidiasis. Candidiasis is a common HIV-related infection. It causes inflammation and a thick, white coating on the mucous membranes of your mouth, tongue, esophagus or vagina. - Cryptococcal meningitis. Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord (meninges). Cryptococcal meningitis is a common central nervous system infection associated with HIV, caused by a fungus found in soil. - Toxoplasmosis. This potentially deadly infection is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite spread primarily by cats. Infected cats pass the parasites in their stools, which may then spread to other animals and humans. Seizures occur when it spreads to the brain. - Cryptosporidiosis. This infection is caused by an intestinal parasite that&apos;s commonly found in animals. You get it when you eat or drink contaminated food or water. The parasite grows in your intestines and bile ducts, leading to severe, chronic diarrhea in people with AIDS. Cancers common to HIV/AIDS - Kaposi&apos;s sarcoma. A tumor of the blood vessel walls, this cancer is rare in people not infected with HIV, but common in HIV-positive people. It usually appears as pink, red or purple lesions on the skin and mouth. In people with darker skin, the lesions may look dark brown or black. Kaposi&apos;s sarcoma can also affect the internal organs, including the digestive tract and lungs. - Lymphoma. This cancer starts in the white blood cells. The most common early sign is painless swelling of the lymph nodes in your neck, armpit or groin. Other complications - Wasting syndrome. Aggressive treatment approaches have reduced the number of cases of wasting syndrome, but it still affects many people with AIDS. It&apos;s defined as a loss of at least 10 percent of body weight, often accompanied by diarrhea, chronic weakness and fever. - Neurological complications. Although AIDS doesn&apos;t appear to infect the nerve cells, it can cause neurological symptoms such as confusion, forgetfulness, depression, anxiety and difficulty walking. One of the most common neurological complications is AIDS dementia complex, which leads to behavioral changes and reduced mental functioning. - Kidney disease. HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is an inflammation of the tiny filters in your kidneys that remove excess fluid and wastes from your blood and pass them to your urine. It most often affects blacks or Hispanics. Anyone with this complication should be started on antiretroviral therapy. HIV is most commonly diagnosed by testing your blood or saliva for antibodies to the virus. Unfortunately, it takes time for your body to develop these antibodies - usually up to 12 weeks. A quicker test checks for HIV antigen, a protein produced by the virus immediately after infection. It can confirm a diagnosis soon after infection and allow the person to take swifter steps to prevent the spread of the virus to others. Home testing At least two Food and Drug Administration-approved home test kits for HIV are available. Depending on which you choose, you&apos;ll need a drop of dried blood or sample of saliva. If the test is positive, you&apos;ll need to see your doctor to confirm the diagnosis and discuss your treatment options. If the test is negative, it needs to be repeated in a few months to confirm the results. Tests to stage disease and treatment If you receive a diagnosis of HIV/AIDS, several tests can help your doctor determine the stage of your disease and the best treatment. These tests include: - CD4 T cell count. CD4 T cells are white blood cells that are specifically targeted and destroyed by HIV. Even if you have no symptoms, HIV infection progresses to AIDS when your CD4 T cell count dips below 200. - Viral load (HIV RNA). This test measures the amount of virus in your blood. A higher viral load has been linked to a worse outcome. - Drug resistance. Some strains of HIV are resistant to medications. This test helps your doctor determine if your specific form of the virus has resistance and guides treatment decisions. Tests for complications Your doctor might also order lab tests to check for other infections or complications, including: - Tuberculosis - Hepatitis - Toxoplasmosis - Sexually transmitted infections - Liver or kidney damage - Urinary tract infection There&apos;s no cure for HIV/AIDS, but many different drugs are available to control the virus. Such treatment is called antiretroviral therapy, or ART. Each class of drug blocks the virus in different ways. ART is now recommended for everyone, regardless of CD4 T cell counts. It&apos;s recommended to combine three drugs from two classes to avoid creating drug-resistant strains of HIV. The classes of anti-HIV drugs include: - Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) turn off a protein needed by HIV to make copies of itself. Examples include efavirenz (Sustiva), etravirine (Intelence) and nevirapine (Viramune). - Nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are faulty versions of the building blocks that HIV needs to make copies of itself. Examples include Abacavir (Ziagen), and the combination drugs emtricitabine/tenofovir (Truvada), Descovy (tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine), and lamivudine-zidovudine (Combivir). - Protease inhibitors (PIs) inactivate HIV protease, another protein that HIV needs to make copies of itself. Examples include atazanavir (Reyataz), darunavir (Prezista), fosamprenavir (Lexiva) and indinavir (Crixivan). - Entry or fusion inhibitors Tblock HIV&apos;s entry into CD4 T cells. Examples include enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) and maraviroc (Selzentry). - Integrase inhibitors work by disabling a protein called integrase, which HIV uses to insert its genetic material into CD4 T cells. Examples include raltegravir (Isentress) and dolutegravir (Tivicay). When to start treatment Everyone with HIV infection, regardless of CD4 T cell count, should be offered antiviral medication. HIV therapy is particularly important for the following situations: - You have severe symptoms. - You have an opportunistic infection. - Your CD4 T cell count is under 350. - You&apos;re pregnant. - You have HIV-related kidney disease. - You&apos;re being treated for hepatitis B or C. Treatment can be difficult HIV treatment plans may involve taking several pills at specific times every day for the rest of your life. Each medication comes with its own unique set of side effects. It&apos;s critical to have regular follow-up appointments with your doctor to monitor your health and treatment. Some of the treatment side effects are: - Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea - Heart disease - Weakened bones or bone loss - Breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis) - Abnormal cholesterol levels - Higher blood sugar Treatment for age-related diseases Some health issues that are a natural part of aging may be more difficult to manage if you have HIV. Some medications that are common for age-related heart, bone or metabolic conditions, for example, may not interact well with anti-HIV medications. It&apos;s important to talk to your doctor about your other health conditions and the medications you are taking. Treatment response Your doctor will monitor your viral load and CD4 T cell counts to determine your response to HIV treatment. CD4 T cell counts should be checked every three to six months. Viral load should be tested at the start of treatment and then every three to four months during therapy. Treatment should lower your viral load so that it&apos;s undetectable. That doesn&apos;t mean your HIV is gone. It just means that the test isn&apos;t sensitive enough to detect it. Along with receiving medical treatment, it&apos;s essential to take an active role in your own care. The following suggestions may help you stay healthy longer: - Eat healthy foods. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein help keep you strong, give you more energy and support your immune system. - Avoid raw meat, eggs and more. Foodborne illnesses can be especially severe in people who are infected with HIV. Cook meat until it&apos;s well-done. Avoid unpasteurized dairy products, raw eggs and raw seafood such as oysters, sushi or sashimi. - Get the right immunizations. These may prevent infections such as pneumonia and the flu. Make sure the vaccines don&apos;t contain live viruses, which can be dangerous for people with weakened immune systems. - Take care with companion animals. Some animals may carry parasites that can cause infections in people who are HIV-positive. Cat feces can cause toxoplasmosis, reptiles can carry salmonella, and birds can carry cryptococcus or histoplasmosis. Wash hands thoroughly after handling pets or emptying the litter box. People who are infected with HIV sometimes try dietary supplements that claim to boost the immune system or counteract side effects of anti-HIV drugs. However, there is no scientific evidence that any nutritional supplement improves immunity, and many may interfere with other medications you are taking. Supplements that may be helpful - Acetyl-L-carnitine. Researchers have used acetyl-L-carnitine to treat nerve pain in people with diabetes. It may also ease nerve pain linked to HIV if you&apos;re lacking in the substance. - Whey protein. Early evidence suggests that whey protein, a cheese byproduct, can help some people with HIV gain weight. Whey protein also appears to reduce diarrhea and increase CD4 T cell counts. Supplements that may be dangerous - St. John&apos;s wort. A common depression remedy, St. John&apos;s wort can reduce the effectiveness of several types of anti-HIV drugs by more than half. - Garlic supplements. Although garlic itself may help strengthen the immune system, garlic supplements interact with several anti-HIV drugs and reduce their ability to work. Occasionally eating garlic in food appears to be safe. Be sure to discuss the use of any dietary supplement with your doctor before trying it to ensure that it won&apos;t adversely interact with any of your medications.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>HIV/AIDS (Causes): HIV is caused by a virus. It can spread through sexual contact or blood, or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding. How does HIV become AIDS? HIV destroys CD4 T cells - white blood cells that play a large role in helping your body fight disease. The fewer CD4 T cells you have, the weaker your immune system becomes. You can have an HIV infection for years before it turns into AIDS. AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 T cell count falls below 200 or you have an AIDS-defining complication. How HIV spreads To become infected with HIV, infected blood, semen or vaginal secretions must enter your body. This can happen in several ways: - By having sex. You may become infected if you have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected partner whose blood, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body. The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that sometimes develop in the rectum or vagina during sexual activity. - From blood transfusions. In some cases, the virus may be transmitted through blood transfusions. American hospitals and blood banks now screen the blood supply for HIV antibodies, so this risk is very small. - By sharing needles. Sharing contaminated intravenous drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) puts you at high risk of HIV and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis. - During pregnancy or delivery or through breast-feeding. Infected mothers can pass the virus on to their babies. HIV-positive mothers who get treatment for the infection during pregnancy can significantly lower the risk to their babies. How HIV doesn&apos;t spread You can&apos;t become infected with HIV through ordinary contact. That means you can&apos;t catch HIV or AIDS by hugging, kissing, dancing or shaking hands with someone who has the infection. HIV isn&apos;t spread through the air, water or insect bites.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ectopic pregnancy: An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants somewhere other than the main cavity of the uterus. Pregnancy begins with a fertilized egg. Normally, the fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining of the uterus. An ectopic pregnancy most often occurs in one of the tubes that carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus (fallopian tubes). This type of ectopic pregnancy is known as a tubal pregnancy. In some cases, however, an ectopic pregnancy occurs in the abdominal cavity, ovary or neck of the uterus (cervix). An ectopic pregnancy can&apos;t proceed normally. The fertilized egg can&apos;t survive, and the growing tissue might destroy various maternal structures. Left untreated, life-threatening blood loss is possible. Early treatment of an ectopic pregnancy can help preserve the chance for future healthy pregnancies. At first, an ectopic pregnancy might not cause any signs or symptoms. In other cases, early signs and symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy might be the same as those of any pregnancy - a missed period, breast tenderness and nausea. If you take a pregnancy test, the result will be positive. Still, an ectopic pregnancy can&apos;t continue as normal. Light vaginal bleeding with abdominal or pelvic pain is often the first warning sign of an ectopic pregnancy. If blood leaks from the fallopian tube, it&apos;s also possible to feel shoulder pain or an urge to have a bowel movement - depending on where the blood pools or which nerves are irritated. If the fallopian tube ruptures, heavy bleeding inside the abdomen is likely - followed by lightheadedness, fainting and shock. When to see a doctor Seek emergency medical help if you experience any signs or symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy, including: - Severe abdominal or pelvic pain accompanied by vaginal bleeding - Extreme lightheadedness or fainting - Shoulder pain A tubal pregnancy - the most common type of ectopic pregnancy - happens when a fertilized egg gets stuck on its way to the uterus, often because the fallopian tube is damaged by inflammation or is misshapen. Hormonal imbalances or abnormal development of the fertilized egg also might play a role. Up to an estimated 20 in every 1,000 pregnancies are ectopic. Various factors are associated with ectopic pregnancy, including: - Previous ectopic pregnancy. If you&apos;ve had one ectopic pregnancy, you&apos;re more likely to have another. - Inflammation or infection. Inflammation of the fallopian tube (salpingitis) or an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes or ovaries (pelvic inflammatory disease) increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy. Often, these infections are caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia. - Fertility issues. Some research suggests an association between difficulties with fertility - as well as use of fertility drugs - and ectopic pregnancy. - Structural concerns. An ectopic pregnancy is more likely if you have an unusually shaped fallopian tube or the fallopian tube was damaged, possibly during surgery. Even surgery to reconstruct the fallopian tube can increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy. - Contraceptive choice. Pregnancy when using an intrauterine device (IUD) is rare. If pregnancy occurs, however, it&apos;s more likely to be ectopic. The same goes for pregnancy after tubal ligation - a permanent method of birth control commonly known as &quot;having your tubes tied.&quot; Although pregnancy after tubal ligation is rare, if it happens, it&apos;s more likely to be ectopic. - Smoking. Cigarette smoking just before you get pregnant can increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy. And the more you smoke, the greater the risk. When you have an ectopic pregnancy, the stakes are high. Without treatment, a ruptured fallopian tube could lead to life-threatening bleeding. If your doctor suspects an ectopic pregnancy, he or she might do a pelvic exam to check for pain, tenderness, or a mass in the fallopian tube or ovary. A physical exam alone usually isn&apos;t enough to diagnose an ectopic pregnancy, however. The diagnosis is typically confirmed with blood tests and imaging studies, such as an ultrasound. With a standard ultrasound, high-frequency sound waves are directed at the tissues in the abdominal area. During early pregnancy, however, the uterus and fallopian tubes are closer to the vagina than to the abdominal surface. The ultrasound will likely be done using a wandlike device placed in your vagina (transvaginal ultrasound). Sometimes it&apos;s too soon to detect a pregnancy through ultrasound. If the diagnosis is in question, your doctor might monitor your condition with blood tests until the ectopic pregnancy can be confirmed or ruled out through ultrasound - usually by four to five weeks after conception. In an emergency situation - if you&apos;re bleeding heavily, for example - an ectopic pregnancy might be diagnosed and treated surgically. A fertilized egg can&apos;t develop normally outside the uterus. To prevent life-threatening complications, the ectopic tissue needs to be removed. If the ectopic pregnancy is detected early, an injection of the drug methotrexate is sometimes used to stop cell growth and dissolve existing cells. It&apos;s imperative that the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is certain before this treatment is undertaken. After the injection, your doctor will monitor your blood for the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). If the HCG level remains high, you might need another injection of methotrexate. In other cases, ectopic pregnancy is usually treated with laparoscopic surgery. In this procedure, a small incision is made in the abdomen, near or in the navel. Then your doctor uses a thin tube equipped with a camera lens and light (laparoscope) to view the area. Other instruments can be inserted into the tube or through other small incisions to remove the ectopic tissue and repair the fallopian tube. If the fallopian tube is significantly damaged, it might need to be removed. If the ectopic pregnancy is causing heavy bleeding or the fallopian tube has ruptured, you might need emergency surgery through an abdominal incision (laparotomy). In some cases, the fallopian tube can be repaired. Typically, however, a ruptured tube must be removed. Your doctor will monitor your HCG levels after surgery to be sure all of the ectopic tissue was removed. If HCG levels don&apos;t come down quickly, an injection of methotrexate may be needed.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ectopic pregnancy: An ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that occurs outside the womb (uterus). It is life-threatening to the mother. In most pregnancies, the fertilized egg travels through the fallopian tube to the womb (uterus). If the movement of the egg is blocked or slowed through the tubes, it can lead to an ectopic pregnancy. Things that may cause this problem include: - Birth defect in the fallopian tubes - Scarring after a ruptured appendix - Endometriosis - Having had an ectopic pregnancy in the past - Scarring from past infections or surgery of the female organs The following also increase risk of an ectopic pregnancy: - Age over 35 - Getting pregnant while having an intrauterine device (IUD) - Having your tubes tied. This is more likely 2 or more years after the procedure - Having had surgery to untie tubes to become pregnant - Having had many sexual partners - Some infertility treatments Sometimes, the cause is unknown. Hormones may play a role. The most common site for an ectopic pregnancy is within 1 of the 2 fallopian tubes. In rare cases, ectopic pregnancies can occur in the ovary, abdomen, or cervix. An ectopic pregnancy can occur even if you use birth control. You may have early pregnancy symptoms, such as breast tenderness or nausea. Other symptoms may include: - Abnormal vaginal bleeding - Low back pain - Mild cramping on one side of the pelvis - No periods - Pain in the lower belly or pelvic area If the area around the abnormal pregnancy ruptures and bleeds, symptoms may get worse. They may include: - Fainting or feeling faint - Intense pressure in the rectum - Low blood pressure - Pain in the shoulder area - Severe, sharp, and sudden pain in the lower abdomen The health care provider will do a pelvic exam. The exam may show tenderness in the pelvic area. A pregnancy test and vaginal ultrasound will be done. HCG is a hormone normally produced during pregnancy. Checking the blood level of this hormone can diagnose pregnancy. If the blood level of HCG is not rising fast enough, your provider may suspect an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy is life threatening. The pregnancy cannot continue to birth (term). The developing cells must be removed to save the mother&apos;s life. If the ectopic pregnancy has not ruptured, treatment may include: - Surgery - Medicine that ends the pregnancy, along with close monitoring by your doctor You will need emergency medical help if the area of the ectopic pregnancy breaks open (ruptures). Rupture can lead to bleeding and shock. Treatment for shock may include: - Blood transfusion - Fluids given through a vein - Keeping warm - Oxygen - Raising the legs If there is a rupture, surgery is done to stop blood loss and remove the pregnancy. In some cases, the doctor may have to remove the fallopian tube. One out of three women who have had 1 ectopic pregnancy are later able to have a baby. Another ectopic pregnancy is more likely to occur. Some women do not become pregnant again. The likelihood of a successful pregnancy after an ectopic pregnancy depends on: - The woman&apos;s age - Whether she has already had children - Why the first ectopic pregnancy occurred Call your provider if you have: - Abnormal vaginal bleeding - Lower abdominal or pelvic pain Most forms of ectopic pregnancy that occur outside the fallopian tubes are probably not preventable. You may be able to reduce your risk by avoiding conditions that may scar the fallopian tubes. These steps include: - Practicing safer sex by taking steps before and during sex, which can prevent you from getting an infection - Getting early diagnosis and treatment of all infections caused by sexual relations (STDs) - Stopping smoking Updated by: Irina Burd, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

After the injection, your doctor will monitor your blood for the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). If the HCG level remains high, you might need another injection of methotrexate. In other cases, ectopic pregnancy is usually treated with laparoscopic surgery. In this procedure, a small incision is made in the abdomen, near or in the navel. Then your doctor uses a thin tube equipped with a camera lens and light (laparoscope) to view the area. Other instruments can be inserted into the tube or through other small incisions to remove the ectopic tissue and repair the fallopian tube. If the fallopian tube is significantly damaged, it might need to be removed. If the ectopic pregnancy is causing heavy bleeding or the fallopian tube has ruptured, you might need emergency surgery through an abdominal incision (laparotomy). In some cases, the fallopian tube can be repaired. Typically, however, a ruptured tube must be removed. Your doctor will monitor your HCG levels after surgery to be sure all of the ectopic tissue was removed. If HCG levels don&apos;t come down quickly, an injection of methotrexate may be needed.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ectopic pregnancy: An ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that occurs outside the womb (uterus). It is life-threatening to the mother. In most pregnancies, the fertilized egg travels through the fallopian tube to the womb (uterus). If the movement of the egg is blocked or slowed through the tubes, it can lead to an ectopic pregnancy. Things that may cause this problem include: - Birth defect in the fallopian tubes - Scarring after a ruptured appendix - Endometriosis - Having had an ectopic pregnancy in the past - Scarring from past infections or surgery of the female organs The following also increase risk of an ectopic pregnancy: - Age over 35 - Getting pregnant while having an intrauterine device (IUD) - Having your tubes tied. This is more likely 2 or more years after the procedure - Having had surgery to untie tubes to become pregnant - Having had many sexual partners - Some infertility treatments Sometimes, the cause is unknown. Hormones may play a role. The most common site for an ectopic pregnancy is within 1 of the 2 fallopian tubes. In rare cases, ectopic pregnancies can occur in the ovary, abdomen, or cervix. An ectopic pregnancy can occur even if you use birth control. You may have early pregnancy symptoms, such as breast tenderness or nausea. Other symptoms may include: - Abnormal vaginal bleeding - Low back pain - Mild cramping on one side of the pelvis - No periods - Pain in the lower belly or pelvic area If the area around the abnormal pregnancy ruptures and bleeds, symptoms may get worse. They may include: - Fainting or feeling faint - Intense pressure in the rectum - Low blood pressure - Pain in the shoulder area - Severe, sharp, and sudden pain in the lower abdomen The health care provider will do a pelvic exam. The exam may show tenderness in the pelvic area. A pregnancy test and vaginal ultrasound will be done. HCG is a hormone normally produced during pregnancy. Checking the blood level of this hormone can diagnose pregnancy. If the blood level of HCG is not rising fast enough, your provider may suspect an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy is life threatening. The pregnancy cannot continue to birth (term). The developing cells must be removed to save the mother&apos;s life. If the ectopic pregnancy has not ruptured, treatment may include: - Surgery - Medicine that ends the pregnancy, along with close monitoring by your doctor You will need emergency medical help if the area of the ectopic pregnancy breaks open (ruptures). Rupture can lead to bleeding and shock. Treatment for shock may include: - Blood transfusion - Fluids given through a vein - Keeping warm - Oxygen - Raising the legs If there is a rupture, surgery is done to stop blood loss and remove the pregnancy. In some cases, the doctor may have to remove the fallopian tube. One out of three women who have had 1 ectopic pregnancy are later able to have a baby. Another ectopic pregnancy is more likely to occur. Some women do not become pregnant again. The likelihood of a successful pregnancy after an ectopic pregnancy depends on: - The woman&apos;s age - Whether she has already had children - Why the first ectopic pregnancy occurred Call your provider if you have: - Abnormal vaginal bleeding - Lower abdominal or pelvic pain Most forms of ectopic pregnancy that occur outside the fallopian tubes are probably not preventable. You may be able to reduce your risk by avoiding conditions that may scar the fallopian tubes. These steps include: - Practicing safer sex by taking steps before and during sex, which can prevent you from getting an infection - Getting early diagnosis and treatment of all infections caused by sexual relations (STDs) - Stopping smoking Updated by: Irina Burd, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

				<AnswerText>Ectopic pregnancy: An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants somewhere other than the main cavity of the uterus. Pregnancy begins with a fertilized egg. Normally, the fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining of the uterus. An ectopic pregnancy most often occurs in one of the tubes that carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus (fallopian tubes). This type of ectopic pregnancy is known as a tubal pregnancy. In some cases, however, an ectopic pregnancy occurs in the abdominal cavity, ovary or neck of the uterus (cervix). An ectopic pregnancy can&apos;t proceed normally. The fertilized egg can&apos;t survive, and the growing tissue might destroy various maternal structures. Left untreated, life-threatening blood loss is possible. Early treatment of an ectopic pregnancy can help preserve the chance for future healthy pregnancies. At first, an ectopic pregnancy might not cause any signs or symptoms. In other cases, early signs and symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy might be the same as those of any pregnancy - a missed period, breast tenderness and nausea. If you take a pregnancy test, the result will be positive. Still, an ectopic pregnancy can&apos;t continue as normal. Light vaginal bleeding with abdominal or pelvic pain is often the first warning sign of an ectopic pregnancy. If blood leaks from the fallopian tube, it&apos;s also possible to feel shoulder pain or an urge to have a bowel movement - depending on where the blood pools or which nerves are irritated. If the fallopian tube ruptures, heavy bleeding inside the abdomen is likely - followed by lightheadedness, fainting and shock. When to see a doctor Seek emergency medical help if you experience any signs or symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy, including: - Severe abdominal or pelvic pain accompanied by vaginal bleeding - Extreme lightheadedness or fainting - Shoulder pain A tubal pregnancy - the most common type of ectopic pregnancy - happens when a fertilized egg gets stuck on its way to the uterus, often because the fallopian tube is damaged by inflammation or is misshapen. Hormonal imbalances or abnormal development of the fertilized egg also might play a role. Up to an estimated 20 in every 1,000 pregnancies are ectopic. Various factors are associated with ectopic pregnancy, including: - Previous ectopic pregnancy. If you&apos;ve had one ectopic pregnancy, you&apos;re more likely to have another. - Inflammation or infection. Inflammation of the fallopian tube (salpingitis) or an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes or ovaries (pelvic inflammatory disease) increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy. Often, these infections are caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia. - Fertility issues. Some research suggests an association between difficulties with fertility - as well as use of fertility drugs - and ectopic pregnancy. - Structural concerns. An ectopic pregnancy is more likely if you have an unusually shaped fallopian tube or the fallopian tube was damaged, possibly during surgery. Even surgery to reconstruct the fallopian tube can increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy. - Contraceptive choice. Pregnancy when using an intrauterine device (IUD) is rare. If pregnancy occurs, however, it&apos;s more likely to be ectopic. The same goes for pregnancy after tubal ligation - a permanent method of birth control commonly known as &quot;having your tubes tied.&quot; Although pregnancy after tubal ligation is rare, if it happens, it&apos;s more likely to be ectopic. - Smoking. Cigarette smoking just before you get pregnant can increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy. And the more you smoke, the greater the risk. When you have an ectopic pregnancy, the stakes are high. Without treatment, a ruptured fallopian tube could lead to life-threatening bleeding. If your doctor suspects an ectopic pregnancy, he or she might do a pelvic exam to check for pain, tenderness, or a mass in the fallopian tube or ovary. A physical exam alone usually isn&apos;t enough to diagnose an ectopic pregnancy, however. The diagnosis is typically confirmed with blood tests and imaging studies, such as an ultrasound. With a standard ultrasound, high-frequency sound waves are directed at the tissues in the abdominal area. During early pregnancy, however, the uterus and fallopian tubes are closer to the vagina than to the abdominal surface. The ultrasound will likely be done using a wandlike device placed in your vagina (transvaginal ultrasound). Sometimes it&apos;s too soon to detect a pregnancy through ultrasound. If the diagnosis is in question, your doctor might monitor your condition with blood tests until the ectopic pregnancy can be confirmed or ruled out through ultrasound - usually by four to five weeks after conception. In an emergency situation - if you&apos;re bleeding heavily, for example - an ectopic pregnancy might be diagnosed and treated surgically. A fertilized egg can&apos;t develop normally outside the uterus. To prevent life-threatening complications, the ectopic tissue needs to be removed. If the ectopic pregnancy is detected early, an injection of the drug methotrexate is sometimes used to stop cell growth and dissolve existing cells. It&apos;s imperative that the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is certain before this treatment is undertaken. After the injection, your doctor will monitor your blood for the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). If the HCG level remains high, you might need another injection of methotrexate.

				<AnswerText>Ectopic pregnancy (Diagnosis): If your doctor suspects an ectopic pregnancy, he or she might do a pelvic exam to check for pain, tenderness, or a mass in the fallopian tube or ovary. A physical exam alone usually isn&apos;t enough to diagnose an ectopic pregnancy, however. The diagnosis is typically confirmed with blood tests and imaging studies, such as an ultrasound. With a standard ultrasound, high-frequency sound waves are directed at the tissues in the abdominal area. During early pregnancy, however, the uterus and fallopian tubes are closer to the vagina than to the abdominal surface. The ultrasound will likely be done using a wandlike device placed in your vagina (transvaginal ultrasound). Sometimes it&apos;s too soon to detect a pregnancy through ultrasound. If the diagnosis is in question, your doctor might monitor your condition with blood tests until the ectopic pregnancy can be confirmed or ruled out through ultrasound - usually by four to five weeks after conception. In an emergency situation - if you&apos;re bleeding heavily, for example - an ectopic pregnancy might be diagnosed and treated surgically.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>How to diagnose Ectopic pregnancy?: The health care provider will do a pelvic exam. The exam may show tenderness in the pelvic area. A pregnancy test and vaginal ultrasound will be done. HCG is a hormone normally produced during pregnancy. Checking the blood level of this hormone (quantitative HCG blood test) can diagnose pregnancy. If the blood level of HCG is not rising fast enough, your doctor may suspect an ectopic pregnancy.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ectopic pregnancy: An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants somewhere other than the main cavity of the uterus. Pregnancy begins with a fertilized egg. Normally, the fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining of the uterus. An ectopic pregnancy most often occurs in one of the tubes that carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus (fallopian tubes). This type of ectopic pregnancy is known as a tubal pregnancy. In some cases, however, an ectopic pregnancy occurs in the abdominal cavity, ovary or neck of the uterus (cervix). An ectopic pregnancy can&apos;t proceed normally. The fertilized egg can&apos;t survive, and the growing tissue might destroy various maternal structures. Left untreated, life-threatening blood loss is possible. Early treatment of an ectopic pregnancy can help preserve the chance for future healthy pregnancies. At first, an ectopic pregnancy might not cause any signs or symptoms. In other cases, early signs and symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy might be the same as those of any pregnancy - a missed period, breast tenderness and nausea. If you take a pregnancy test, the result will be positive. Still, an ectopic pregnancy can&apos;t continue as normal. Light vaginal bleeding with abdominal or pelvic pain is often the first warning sign of an ectopic pregnancy. If blood leaks from the fallopian tube, it&apos;s also possible to feel shoulder pain or an urge to have a bowel movement - depending on where the blood pools or which nerves are irritated. If the fallopian tube ruptures, heavy bleeding inside the abdomen is likely - followed by lightheadedness, fainting and shock. When to see a doctor Seek emergency medical help if you experience any signs or symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy, including: - Severe abdominal or pelvic pain accompanied by vaginal bleeding - Extreme lightheadedness or fainting - Shoulder pain A tubal pregnancy - the most common type of ectopic pregnancy - happens when a fertilized egg gets stuck on its way to the uterus, often because the fallopian tube is damaged by inflammation or is misshapen. Hormonal imbalances or abnormal development of the fertilized egg also might play a role. Up to an estimated 20 in every 1,000 pregnancies are ectopic. Various factors are associated with ectopic pregnancy, including: - Previous ectopic pregnancy. If you&apos;ve had one ectopic pregnancy, you&apos;re more likely to have another. - Inflammation or infection. Inflammation of the fallopian tube (salpingitis) or an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes or ovaries (pelvic inflammatory disease) increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy. Often, these infections are caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia. - Fertility issues. Some research suggests an association between difficulties with fertility - as well as use of fertility drugs - and ectopic pregnancy. - Structural concerns. An ectopic pregnancy is more likely if you have an unusually shaped fallopian tube or the fallopian tube was damaged, possibly during surgery. Even surgery to reconstruct the fallopian tube can increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy. - Contraceptive choice. Pregnancy when using an intrauterine device (IUD) is rare. If pregnancy occurs, however, it&apos;s more likely to be ectopic. The same goes for pregnancy after tubal ligation - a permanent method of birth control commonly known as &quot;having your tubes tied.&quot; Although pregnancy after tubal ligation is rare, if it happens, it&apos;s more likely to be ectopic. - Smoking. Cigarette smoking just before you get pregnant can increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy. And the more you smoke, the greater the risk. When you have an ectopic pregnancy, the stakes are high. Without treatment, a ruptured fallopian tube could lead to life-threatening bleeding. If your doctor suspects an ectopic pregnancy, he or she might do a pelvic exam to check for pain, tenderness, or a mass in the fallopian tube or ovary. A physical exam alone usually isn&apos;t enough to diagnose an ectopic pregnancy, however. The diagnosis is typically confirmed with blood tests and imaging studies, such as an ultrasound. With a standard ultrasound, high-frequency sound waves are directed at the tissues in the abdominal area. During early pregnancy, however, the uterus and fallopian tubes are closer to the vagina than to the abdominal surface.

If the diagnosis is in question, your doctor might monitor your condition with blood tests until the ectopic pregnancy can be confirmed or ruled out through ultrasound - usually by four to five weeks after conception. In an emergency situation - if you&apos;re bleeding heavily, for example - an ectopic pregnancy might be diagnosed and treated surgically. A fertilized egg can&apos;t develop normally outside the uterus. To prevent life-threatening complications, the ectopic tissue needs to be removed. If the ectopic pregnancy is detected early, an injection of the drug methotrexate is sometimes used to stop cell growth and dissolve existing cells. It&apos;s imperative that the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is certain before this treatment is undertaken. After the injection, your doctor will monitor your blood for the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). If the HCG level remains high, you might need another injection of methotrexate. In other cases, ectopic pregnancy is usually treated with laparoscopic surgery. In this procedure, a small incision is made in the abdomen, near or in the navel. Then your doctor uses a thin tube equipped with a camera lens and light (laparoscope) to view the area. Other instruments can be inserted into the tube or through other small incisions to remove the ectopic tissue and repair the fallopian tube. If the fallopian tube is significantly damaged, it might need to be removed. If the ectopic pregnancy is causing heavy bleeding or the fallopian tube has ruptured, you might need emergency surgery through an abdominal incision (laparotomy). In some cases, the fallopian tube can be repaired. Typically, however, a ruptured tube must be removed. Your doctor will monitor your HCG levels after surgery to be sure all of the ectopic tissue was removed. If HCG levels don&apos;t come down quickly, an injection of methotrexate may be needed.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ectopic pregnancy: An ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that occurs outside the womb (uterus). It is life-threatening to the mother. In most pregnancies, the fertilized egg travels through the fallopian tube to the womb (uterus). If the movement of the egg is blocked or slowed through the tubes, it can lead to an ectopic pregnancy. Things that may cause this problem include: - Birth defect in the fallopian tubes - Scarring after a ruptured appendix - Endometriosis - Having had an ectopic pregnancy in the past - Scarring from past infections or surgery of the female organs The following also increase risk of an ectopic pregnancy: - Age over 35 - Getting pregnant while having an intrauterine device (IUD) - Having your tubes tied. This is more likely 2 or more years after the procedure - Having had surgery to untie tubes to become pregnant - Having had many sexual partners - Some infertility treatments Sometimes, the cause is unknown. Hormones may play a role. The most common site for an ectopic pregnancy is within 1 of the 2 fallopian tubes. In rare cases, ectopic pregnancies can occur in the ovary, abdomen, or cervix. An ectopic pregnancy can occur even if you use birth control. You may have early pregnancy symptoms, such as breast tenderness or nausea. Other symptoms may include: - Abnormal vaginal bleeding - Low back pain - Mild cramping on one side of the pelvis - No periods - Pain in the lower belly or pelvic area If the area around the abnormal pregnancy ruptures and bleeds, symptoms may get worse. They may include: - Fainting or feeling faint - Intense pressure in the rectum - Low blood pressure - Pain in the shoulder area - Severe, sharp, and sudden pain in the lower abdomen The health care provider will do a pelvic exam. The exam may show tenderness in the pelvic area. A pregnancy test and vaginal ultrasound will be done. HCG is a hormone normally produced during pregnancy. Checking the blood level of this hormone can diagnose pregnancy. If the blood level of HCG is not rising fast enough, your provider may suspect an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy is life threatening. The pregnancy cannot continue to birth (term). The developing cells must be removed to save the mother&apos;s life. If the ectopic pregnancy has not ruptured, treatment may include: - Surgery - Medicine that ends the pregnancy, along with close monitoring by your doctor You will need emergency medical help if the area of the ectopic pregnancy breaks open (ruptures). Rupture can lead to bleeding and shock. Treatment for shock may include: - Blood transfusion - Fluids given through a vein - Keeping warm - Oxygen - Raising the legs If there is a rupture, surgery is done to stop blood loss and remove the pregnancy. In some cases, the doctor may have to remove the fallopian tube. One out of three women who have had 1 ectopic pregnancy are later able to have a baby. Another ectopic pregnancy is more likely to occur. Some women do not become pregnant again. The likelihood of a successful pregnancy after an ectopic pregnancy depends on: - The woman&apos;s age - Whether she has already had children - Why the first ectopic pregnancy occurred Call your provider if you have: - Abnormal vaginal bleeding - Lower abdominal or pelvic pain Most forms of ectopic pregnancy that occur outside the fallopian tubes are probably not preventable. You may be able to reduce your risk by avoiding conditions that may scar the fallopian tubes. These steps include: - Practicing safer sex by taking steps before and during sex, which can prevent you from getting an infection - Getting early diagnosis and treatment of all infections caused by sexual relations (STDs) - Stopping smoking Updated by: Irina Burd, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

				<AnswerText>Appendicitis: Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. The appendix is a small pouch attached to the large intestine. Appendicitis is a very common cause of emergency surgery. The problem most often occurs when the appendix becomes blocked by feces, a foreign object, or rarely, a tumor. The symptoms of appendicitis can vary. It can be hard to diagnose appendicitis in young children, older people, and women of childbearing age. The first symptom is often pain around the belly button or mid upper abdomen. Pain may be minor at first, but becomes more sharp and severe. You may also have a loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and a low-grade fever. The pain tends to move into the right lower part of your belly. The pain tends to focus at a spot directly above the appendix called McBurney point. This most often occurs 12 to 24 hours after the illness starts. Your pain may be worse when you walk, cough, or make sudden movements. Later symptoms include: - Chills and shaking - Hard stools - Diarrhea - Fever - Nausea and vomiting Your health care provider may suspect appendicitis based on the symptoms you describe. Your provider will do a physical exam. - If you have appendicitis, your pain will increase when your lower right belly area is pressed. - If your appendix has ruptured, touching the belly area may cause a lot of pain and lead you to tighten your muscles. - A rectal exam may find tenderness on the right side of your rectum. A blood test will often show a high white blood cell count. Imaging tests may also help diagnose appendicitis. Imaging tests include: - CT scan of the abdomen - Ultrasound of the abdomen Most of the time, a surgeon will remove your appendix as soon as you are diagnosed. If a CT scan shows that you have an abscess, you may be treated with antibiotics first. You will have your appendix removed after the infection and swelling have gone away. The tests used to diagnose appendicitis are not perfect. As a result, the operation may show that your appendix is normal. In that case, the surgeon will remove your appendix and explore the rest of your abdomen for other causes of your pain. Most people recover quickly after surgery if the appendix is removed before it ruptures. If your appendix ruptures before surgery, recovery may take longer. You are also more likely to develop problems, such as: - An abscess - Blockage of the intestine - Infection inside the abdomen (peritonitis) - Infection of the wound after surgery Call your provider if you have abdominal pain in the lower-right portion of your belly, or other symptoms of appendicitis.

In the United States, appendicitis is the most common cause of acute abdominal pain requiring surgery. Over 5% of the population develops appendicitis at some point.1 Appendicitis most commonly occurs in the teens and twenties but may occur at any age.1 If appendicitis is not treated, it may lead to complications. The complications of a ruptured appendix areperitonitis, which can be a dangerous condition. Peritonitis happens if your appendix bursts and infection spreads in your abdomen. If you have peritonitis, you may be very ill and have fever nausea severe tenderness in your abdomen vomiting an abscess of the appendix called an appendiceal abscess. The most common symptom of appendicitis is pain in your abdomen.If you have appendicitis, you’ll most often have pain in your abdomen thatbegins near your belly button and then moves lower and to your right gets worse in a matter of hours gets worse when you move around, take deep breaths, cough, or sneeze is severe and often described as different from any pain you’ve felt before occurs suddenly and may even wake you up if you’re sleeping occurs before other symptomsOther symptoms of appendicitis may includeloss of appetite nausea vomiting constipation or diarrhea an inability to pass gas a low-grade fever swelling in your abdomen the feeling that having a bowel movement will relieve discomfortSymptoms can be different for each person and can seem like the following conditions that also cause pain in the abdomen:abdominal adhesions constipation inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, long-lasting disorders that cause irritation and ulcers in the GI tract intestinal obstruction pelvic inflammatory disease The most common symptom of appendicitis is pain in your abdomen.If you have appendicitis, you’ll most often have pain in your abdomen thatbegins near your belly button and then moves lower and to your right gets worse in a matter of hours gets worse when you move around, take deep breaths, cough, or sneeze is severe and often described as different from any pain you’ve felt before occurs suddenly and may even wake you up if you’re sleeping occurs before other symptomsOther symptoms of appendicitis may includeloss of appetite nausea vomiting constipation or diarrhea an inability to pass gas a low-grade fever swelling in your abdomen the feeling that having a bowel movement will relieve discomfortSymptoms can be different for each person and can seem like the following conditions that also cause pain in the abdomen:abdominal adhesions constipation inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, long-lasting disorders that cause irritation and ulcers in the GI tract intestinal obstruction pelvic inflammatory disease Appendicitis can have more than one cause, and in many cases the cause is not clear. Possible causes include:Blockage of the opening inside the appendix enlarged tissue in the wall of your appendix, caused by infection in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or elsewhere in your body inflammatory bowel disease stool, parasites, or growths that can clog your appendiceal lumen trauma to your abdomen Appendicitis is a medical emergency that requires immediate care. See a health care professional or go to the emergency room right away if you think you or a child has appendicitis. A doctor can help treat the appendicitis and reduce symptoms and the chance of complications. Most often, health care professionals suspect the diagnosis of appendicitis based on your symptoms, your medical history, and a physical exam. A doctor can confirm the diagnosis with an ultrasound, x-ray, or MRI exam.A health care professional will ask specific questions about your symptoms and health history to help rule out other health problems. The health care professional will want to knowwhen your abdominal pain began the exact location and severity of your pain when your other symptoms appeared your other medical conditions, previous illnesses, and surgical procedures whether you use medicines, alcohol, or illegal drugsHealth care professionals need specific details about the pain in your abdomen to diagnose appendicitis correctly. A health care professional will assess your pain by touching or applying pressure to specific areas of your abdomen.The following responses to touch or pressure may indicate that you have appendicitis:Rovsing&apos;s sign Psoas sign Obturator sign Guarding Rebound tenderness Digital rectal exam Pelvic examDoctors use lab tests to help confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis or find other causes of abdominal pain.Blood tests. A health care professional draws your blood for a blood test at a doctor’s office or a commercial facility. The health care professional sends the blood sample to a lab for testing. Blood tests can show a high white blood cell count, a sign of infection. Blood tests also may show dehydration or fluid and electrolyte imbalances.Urinalysis. Urinalysis is testing of a urine sample. You will provide a urine sample in a special container in a doctor’s office, a commercial facility, or a hospital. Health care professionals can test the urine in the same location or send it to a lab for testing. Doctors use urinalysis to rule out a urinary tract infection or a kidney stone.Pregnancy test. For women, health care professionals also may order blood or urine samples to check for pregnancy.Doctors use imaging tests to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis or find other causes of pain in the abdomen.Abdominal ultrasound. In an ultrasound, a health care professional uses a device, called a transducer, to bounce safe, painless sound waves off of your organs to create an image of their structure. He or she can move the transducer to different angles to examine different organs.In an abdominal ultrasound, a health care professional applies a gel to your abdomen and moves a hand-held transducer over your skin.

The radiation from CT scans can be harmful to a developing fetus. Doctors typically treat appendicitis with surgery to remove the appendix. Surgeons perform the surgery in a hospital with general anesthesia. Your doctor will recommend surgery if you have continuous abdominal pain and fever, or signs of a burst appendix and infection. Prompt surgery decreases the chance that your appendix will burst.Health care professionals call the surgery to remove the appendix an appendectomy. A surgeon performs the surgery using one of the following methods:Laparoscopic surgery. During laparoscopic surgery, surgeons use several smaller incisions and special surgical tools that they feed through the incisions to remove your appendix. Laparoscopic surgery leads to fewer complications, such as hospital-related infections, and has a shorter recovery time. Laparotomy. Surgeons use laparotomy to remove the appendix through a single incision in the lower right area of your abdomen.After surgery, most patients completely recover from appendicitis and don’t need to make changes to their diet, exercise, or lifestyle. Surgeons recommend that you limit physical activity for the first 10 to 14 days after a laparotomy and for the first 3 to 5 days after laparoscopic surgery. Doctors typically treat appendicitis with surgery to remove the appendix. Surgeons perform the surgery in a hospital with general anesthesia. Your doctor will recommend surgery if you have continuous abdominal pain and fever, or signs of a burst appendix and infection. Prompt surgery decreases the chance that your appendix will burst.Health care professionals call the surgery to remove the appendix an appendectomy. A surgeon performs the surgery using one of the following methods:Laparoscopic surgery. During laparoscopic surgery, surgeons use several smaller incisions and special surgical tools that they feed through the incisions to remove your appendix. Laparoscopic surgery leads to fewer complications, such as hospital-related infections, and has a shorter recovery time. Laparotomy. Surgeons use laparotomy to remove the appendix through a single incision in the lower right area of your abdomen.After surgery, most patients completely recover from appendicitis and don’t need to make changes to their diet, exercise, or lifestyle. Surgeons recommend that you limit physical activity for the first 10 to 14 days after a laparotomy and for the first 3 to 5 days after laparoscopic surgery. In some cases, a surgeon finds a normal appendix during surgery. In this case, many surgeons will remove it to eliminate the future possibility of appendicitis. Sometimes surgeons find a different problem, which they may correct during surgery. Some cases of mild appendicitis may be cured with antibiotics alone. All patients suspected of having appendicitis are treated with antibiotics before surgery, and some patients may improve completely before surgery is performed. Treating the complications of a burst appendix will depend on the type of complication. In most cases of peritonitis, a surgeon will remove your appendix immediately with surgery. The surgeon will use laparotomy to clean the inside of your abdomen to prevent infection and then remove your appendix. Without prompt treatment, peritonitis can cause death.A surgeon may drain the pus from an appendiceal abscess during surgery or, more commonly, before surgery. To drain an abscess, the surgeon places a tube in the abscess through the abdominal wall. You leave the drainage tube in place for about 2 weeks while you take antibiotics to treat infection. When the infection and inflammation are under control, about 6 to 8 weeks later, surgeons operate to remove what remains of the burst appendix.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Appendicitis: Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, a finger-shaped pouch that projects from your colon on the lower right side of your abdomen. The appendix doesn&apos;t seem to have a specific purpose. Appendicitis causes pain in your lower right abdomen. However, in most people, pain begins around the navel and then moves. As inflammation worsens, appendicitis pain typically increases and eventually becomes severe. Although anyone can develop appendicitis, most often it occurs in people between the ages of 10 and 30. Standard treatment is surgical removal of the appendix. Signs and symptoms of appendicitis may include: - Sudden pain that begins on the right side of the lower abdomen - Sudden pain that begins around your navel and often shifts to your lower right abdomen - Pain that worsens if you cough, walk or make other jarring movements - Nausea and vomiting - Loss of appetite - Low-grade fever that may worsen as the illness progresses - Constipation or diarrhea - Abdominal bloating The site of your pain may vary, depending on your age and the position of your appendix. When you&apos;re pregnant, the pain may seem to come from your upper abdomen because your appendix is higher during pregnancy. When to see a doctor Make an appointment with a doctor if you or your child has worrisome signs or symptoms. Severe abdominal pain requires immediate medical attention. A blockage in the lining of the appendix that results in infection is the likely cause of appendicitis. The bacteria multiply rapidly, causing the appendix to become inflamed, swollen and filled with pus. If not treated promptly, the appendix can rupture. To help diagnose appendicitis, your doctor will likely take a history of your signs and symptoms and examine your abdomen. Tests and procedures used to diagnose appendicitis include: - Physical exam to assess your pain. Your doctor may apply gentle pressure on the painful area. When the pressure is suddenly released, appendicitis pain will often feel worse, signaling that the adjacent peritoneum is inflamed. Your doctor also may look for abdominal rigidity and a tendency for you to stiffen your abdominal muscles in response to pressure over the inflamed appendix (guarding). Your doctor may use a lubricated, gloved finger to examine your lower rectum (digital rectal exam). Women of childbearing age may be given a pelvic exam to check for possible gynecological problems that could be causing the pain. - Blood test. This allows your doctor to check for a high white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection. - Urine test. Your doctor may want you to have a urinalysis to make sure that a urinary tract infection or a kidney stone isn&apos;t causing your pain. - Imaging tests. Your doctor may also recommend an abdominal X-ray, an abdominal ultrasound or a computerized tomography (CT) scan to help confirm appendicitis or find other causes for your pain. Appendicitis treatment usually involves surgery to remove the inflamed appendix. Before surgery you may be given a dose of antibiotics to prevent infection. Surgery to remove the appendix (appendectomy) Appendectomy can be performed as open surgery using one abdominal incision about 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) long (laparotomy). Or the surgery can be done through a few small abdominal incisions (laparoscopic surgery). During a laparoscopic appendectomy, the surgeon inserts special surgical tools and a video camera into your abdomen to remove your appendix. In general, laparoscopic surgery allows you to recover faster and heal with less pain and scarring. It may be better for people who are elderly or obese. But laparoscopic surgery isn&apos;t appropriate for everyone. If your appendix has ruptured and infection has spread beyond the appendix or you have an abscess, you may need an open appendectomy, which allows your surgeon to clean the abdominal cavity. Expect to spend one or two days in the hospital after your appendectomy. Draining an abscess before appendix surgery If your appendix has burst and an abscess has formed around it, the abscess may be drained by placing a tube through your skin into the abscess. Appendectomy can be performed several weeks later after controlling the infection. Expect a few weeks of recovery from an appendectomy, or longer if your appendix burst. To help your body heal: - Avoid strenuous activity at first. If your appendectomy was done laparoscopically, limit your activity for three to five days. If you had an open appendectomy, limit your activity for 10 to 14 days. Always ask your doctor about limitations on your activity and when you can resume normal activities following surgery. - Support your abdomen when you cough. Place a pillow over your abdomen and apply pressure before you cough, laugh or move to help reduce pain. - Call your doctor if your pain medications aren&apos;t helping. Being in pain puts extra stress on your body and slows the healing process. If you&apos;re still in pain despite your pain medications, call your doctor. - Get up and move when you&apos;re ready. Start slowly and increase your activity as you feel up to it. Start with short walks. - Sleep when tired. As your body heals, you may find you feel sleepier than usual. Take it easy and rest when you need to. - Discuss returning to work or school with your doctor. You can return to work when you feel up to it. Children may be able to return to school less than a week after surgery. They should wait two to four weeks to resume strenuous activity, such as gym classes or sports. Your doctor will prescribe medications to help you control your pain after your appendectomy. Some complementary and alternative treatments, when used with your medications, can help control pain. Ask your doctor about safe options, such as: - Distracting activities, such as listening to music and talking with friends, that take your mind off your pain. Distraction can be especially effective with children. - Guided imagery, such as closing your eyes and thinking about a favorite place.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Appendicitis (Summary): Summary The appendix is a small, tube-like organ attached to the first part of the large intestine. It is located in the lower right part of the abdomen. It has no known function. A blockage inside of the appendix causes appendicitis. The blockage leads to increased pressure, problems with blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, the appendix can burst and spread infection into the abdomen. This causes a condition called peritonitis. The main symptom is pain in the abdomen, often on the right side. It is usually sudden and gets worse over time. Other symptoms may include - Swelling in the abdomen - Loss of appetite - Nausea and vomiting - Constipation or diarrhea - Inability to pass gas - Low fever Not everyone with appendicitis has all these symptoms. Appendicitis is a medical emergency. Treatment almost always involves removing the appendix. Anyone can get appendicitis, but it is more common among people 10 to 30 years old.

				<AnswerText>Appendicitis: Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. The appendix is a small pouch attached to the large intestine. Appendicitis is a very common cause of emergency surgery. The problem most often occurs when the appendix becomes blocked by feces, a foreign object, or rarely, a tumor. The symptoms of appendicitis can vary. It can be hard to diagnose appendicitis in young children, older people, and women of childbearing age. The first symptom is often pain around the belly button or mid upper abdomen. Pain may be minor at first, but becomes more sharp and severe. You may also have a loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and a low-grade fever. The pain tends to move into the right lower part of your belly. The pain tends to focus at a spot directly above the appendix called McBurney point. This most often occurs 12 to 24 hours after the illness starts. Your pain may be worse when you walk, cough, or make sudden movements. Later symptoms include: - Chills and shaking - Hard stools - Diarrhea - Fever - Nausea and vomiting Your health care provider may suspect appendicitis based on the symptoms you describe. Your provider will do a physical exam. - If you have appendicitis, your pain will increase when your lower right belly area is pressed. - If your appendix has ruptured, touching the belly area may cause a lot of pain and lead you to tighten your muscles. - A rectal exam may find tenderness on the right side of your rectum. A blood test will often show a high white blood cell count. Imaging tests may also help diagnose appendicitis. Imaging tests include: - CT scan of the abdomen - Ultrasound of the abdomen Most of the time, a surgeon will remove your appendix as soon as you are diagnosed. If a CT scan shows that you have an abscess, you may be treated with antibiotics first. You will have your appendix removed after the infection and swelling have gone away. The tests used to diagnose appendicitis are not perfect. As a result, the operation may show that your appendix is normal. In that case, the surgeon will remove your appendix and explore the rest of your abdomen for other causes of your pain. Most people recover quickly after surgery if the appendix is removed before it ruptures. If your appendix ruptures before surgery, recovery may take longer. You are also more likely to develop problems, such as: - An abscess - Blockage of the intestine - Infection inside the abdomen (peritonitis) - Infection of the wound after surgery Call your provider if you have abdominal pain in the lower-right portion of your belly, or other symptoms of appendicitis.

To help your body heal: - Avoid strenuous activity at first. If your appendectomy was done laparoscopically, limit your activity for three to five days. If you had an open appendectomy, limit your activity for 10 to 14 days. Always ask your doctor about limitations on your activity and when you can resume normal activities following surgery. - Support your abdomen when you cough. Place a pillow over your abdomen and apply pressure before you cough, laugh or move to help reduce pain. - Call your doctor if your pain medications aren&apos;t helping. Being in pain puts extra stress on your body and slows the healing process. If you&apos;re still in pain despite your pain medications, call your doctor. - Get up and move when you&apos;re ready. Start slowly and increase your activity as you feel up to it. Start with short walks. - Sleep when tired. As your body heals, you may find you feel sleepier than usual. Take it easy and rest when you need to. - Discuss returning to work or school with your doctor. You can return to work when you feel up to it. Children may be able to return to school less than a week after surgery. They should wait two to four weeks to resume strenuous activity, such as gym classes or sports. Your doctor will prescribe medications to help you control your pain after your appendectomy. Some complementary and alternative treatments, when used with your medications, can help control pain. Ask your doctor about safe options, such as: - Distracting activities, such as listening to music and talking with friends, that take your mind off your pain. Distraction can be especially effective with children. - Guided imagery, such as closing your eyes and thinking about a favorite place.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Appendicitis: Appendicitis is inflammation of your appendix. Appendicitis is inflammation of your appendix. In the United States, appendicitis is the most common cause of acute abdominal pain requiring surgery. Over 5% of the population develops appendicitis at some point.1 Appendicitis most commonly occurs in the teens and twenties but may occur at any age.1 If appendicitis is not treated, it may lead to complications. The complications of a ruptured appendix areperitonitis, which can be a dangerous condition. Peritonitis happens if your appendix bursts and infection spreads in your abdomen. If you have peritonitis, you may be very ill and have fever nausea severe tenderness in your abdomen vomiting an abscess of the appendix called an appendiceal abscess. The most common symptom of appendicitis is pain in your abdomen.If you have appendicitis, you’ll most often have pain in your abdomen thatbegins near your belly button and then moves lower and to your right gets worse in a matter of hours gets worse when you move around, take deep breaths, cough, or sneeze is severe and often described as different from any pain you’ve felt before occurs suddenly and may even wake you up if you’re sleeping occurs before other symptomsOther symptoms of appendicitis may includeloss of appetite nausea vomiting constipation or diarrhea an inability to pass gas a low-grade fever swelling in your abdomen the feeling that having a bowel movement will relieve discomfortSymptoms can be different for each person and can seem like the following conditions that also cause pain in the abdomen:abdominal adhesions constipation inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, long-lasting disorders that cause irritation and ulcers in the GI tract intestinal obstruction pelvic inflammatory disease The most common symptom of appendicitis is pain in your abdomen.If you have appendicitis, you’ll most often have pain in your abdomen thatbegins near your belly button and then moves lower and to your right gets worse in a matter of hours gets worse when you move around, take deep breaths, cough, or sneeze is severe and often described as different from any pain you’ve felt before occurs suddenly and may even wake you up if you’re sleeping occurs before other symptomsOther symptoms of appendicitis may includeloss of appetite nausea vomiting constipation or diarrhea an inability to pass gas a low-grade fever swelling in your abdomen the feeling that having a bowel movement will relieve discomfortSymptoms can be different for each person and can seem like the following conditions that also cause pain in the abdomen:abdominal adhesions constipation inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, long-lasting disorders that cause irritation and ulcers in the GI tract intestinal obstruction pelvic inflammatory disease Appendicitis can have more than one cause, and in many cases the cause is not clear. Possible causes include:Blockage of the opening inside the appendix enlarged tissue in the wall of your appendix, caused by infection in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or elsewhere in your body inflammatory bowel disease stool, parasites, or growths that can clog your appendiceal lumen trauma to your abdomen Appendicitis is a medical emergency that requires immediate care. See a health care professional or go to the emergency room right away if you think you or a child has appendicitis. A doctor can help treat the appendicitis and reduce symptoms and the chance of complications.

Surgeons perform the surgery in a hospital with general anesthesia. Your doctor will recommend surgery if you have continuous abdominal pain and fever, or signs of a burst appendix and infection. Prompt surgery decreases the chance that your appendix will burst.Health care professionals call the surgery to remove the appendix an appendectomy. A surgeon performs the surgery using one of the following methods:Laparoscopic surgery. During laparoscopic surgery, surgeons use several smaller incisions and special surgical tools that they feed through the incisions to remove your appendix. Laparoscopic surgery leads to fewer complications, such as hospital-related infections, and has a shorter recovery time. Laparotomy. Surgeons use laparotomy to remove the appendix through a single incision in the lower right area of your abdomen.After surgery, most patients completely recover from appendicitis and don’t need to make changes to their diet, exercise, or lifestyle. Surgeons recommend that you limit physical activity for the first 10 to 14 days after a laparotomy and for the first 3 to 5 days after laparoscopic surgery.

In some cases, a surgeon finds a normal appendix during surgery. In this case, many surgeons will remove it to eliminate the future possibility of appendicitis. Sometimes surgeons find a different problem, which they may correct during surgery. Some cases of mild appendicitis may be cured with antibiotics alone. All patients suspected of having appendicitis are treated with antibiotics before surgery, and some patients may improve completely before surgery is performed. Treating the complications of a burst appendix will depend on the type of complication. In most cases of peritonitis, a surgeon will remove your appendix immediately with surgery. The surgeon will use laparotomy to clean the inside of your abdomen to prevent infection and then remove your appendix. Without prompt treatment, peritonitis can cause death.A surgeon may drain the pus from an appendiceal abscess during surgery or, more commonly, before surgery. To drain an abscess, the surgeon places a tube in the abscess through the abdominal wall. You leave the drainage tube in place for about 2 weeks while you take antibiotics to treat infection. When the infection and inflammation are under control, about 6 to 8 weeks later, surgeons operate to remove what remains of the burst appendix.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Appendicitis (Treatment): Appendicitis treatment usually involves surgery to remove the inflamed appendix. Before surgery you may be given a dose of antibiotics to prevent infection. Surgery to remove the appendix (appendectomy) Appendectomy can be performed as open surgery using one abdominal incision about 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) long (laparotomy). Or the surgery can be done through a few small abdominal incisions (laparoscopic surgery). During a laparoscopic appendectomy, the surgeon inserts special surgical tools and a video camera into your abdomen to remove your appendix. In general, laparoscopic surgery allows you to recover faster and heal with less pain and scarring. It may be better for people who are elderly or obese. But laparoscopic surgery isn&apos;t appropriate for everyone. If your appendix has ruptured and infection has spread beyond the appendix or you have an abscess, you may need an open appendectomy, which allows your surgeon to clean the abdominal cavity. Expect to spend one or two days in the hospital after your appendectomy. Draining an abscess before appendix surgery If your appendix has burst and an abscess has formed around it, the abscess may be drained by placing a tube through your skin into the abscess. Appendectomy can be performed several weeks later after controlling the infection.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Appendicitis (Summary): Summary The appendix is a small, tube-like organ attached to the first part of the large intestine. It is located in the lower right part of the abdomen. It has no known function. A blockage inside of the appendix causes appendicitis. The blockage leads to increased pressure, problems with blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, the appendix can burst and spread infection into the abdomen. This causes a condition called peritonitis. The main symptom is pain in the abdomen, often on the right side. It is usually sudden and gets worse over time. Other symptoms may include - Swelling in the abdomen - Loss of appetite - Nausea and vomiting - Constipation or diarrhea - Inability to pass gas - Low fever Not everyone with appendicitis has all these symptoms. Appendicitis is a medical emergency. Treatment almost always involves removing the appendix. Anyone can get appendicitis, but it is more common among people 10 to 30 years old.

				<AnswerText>Appendicitis (Diagnosis): To help diagnose appendicitis, your doctor will likely take a history of your signs and symptoms and examine your abdomen. Tests and procedures used to diagnose appendicitis include: - Physical exam to assess your pain. Your doctor may apply gentle pressure on the painful area. When the pressure is suddenly released, appendicitis pain will often feel worse, signaling that the adjacent peritoneum is inflamed. Your doctor also may look for abdominal rigidity and a tendency for you to stiffen your abdominal muscles in response to pressure over the inflamed appendix (guarding). Your doctor may use a lubricated, gloved finger to examine your lower rectum (digital rectal exam). Women of childbearing age may be given a pelvic exam to check for possible gynecological problems that could be causing the pain. - Blood test. This allows your doctor to check for a high white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection. - Urine test. Your doctor may want you to have a urinalysis to make sure that a urinary tract infection or a kidney stone isn&apos;t causing your pain. - Imaging tests. Your doctor may also recommend an abdominal X-ray, an abdominal ultrasound or a computerized tomography (CT) scan to help confirm appendicitis or find other causes for your pain.</AnswerText>

The tests used to diagnose appendicitis are not perfect. As a result, the operation may show that your appendix is normal. In that case, the surgeon will remove your appendix and explore the rest of your abdomen for other causes of your pain.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Appendicitis (Symptoms): The symptoms of appendicitis can vary. It can be hard to diagnose appendicitis in young children, older people, and women of childbearing age. The first symptom is often pain around the belly button or mid upper abdomen. Pain may be minor at first, but becomes more sharp and severe. You may also have a loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and a low-grade fever. The pain tends to move into the right lower part of your belly. The pain tends to focus at a spot directly above the appendix called McBurney point. This most often occurs 12 to 24 hours after the illness starts. Your pain may be worse when you walk, cough, or make sudden movements. Later symptoms include: - Chills and shaking - Hard stools - Diarrhea - Fever - Nausea and vomiting</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Appendicitis: Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, a finger-shaped pouch that projects from your colon on the lower right side of your abdomen. The appendix doesn&apos;t seem to have a specific purpose. Appendicitis causes pain in your lower right abdomen. However, in most people, pain begins around the navel and then moves. As inflammation worsens, appendicitis pain typically increases and eventually becomes severe. Although anyone can develop appendicitis, most often it occurs in people between the ages of 10 and 30. Standard treatment is surgical removal of the appendix. Signs and symptoms of appendicitis may include: - Sudden pain that begins on the right side of the lower abdomen - Sudden pain that begins around your navel and often shifts to your lower right abdomen - Pain that worsens if you cough, walk or make other jarring movements - Nausea and vomiting - Loss of appetite - Low-grade fever that may worsen as the illness progresses - Constipation or diarrhea - Abdominal bloating The site of your pain may vary, depending on your age and the position of your appendix. When you&apos;re pregnant, the pain may seem to come from your upper abdomen because your appendix is higher during pregnancy. When to see a doctor Make an appointment with a doctor if you or your child has worrisome signs or symptoms. Severe abdominal pain requires immediate medical attention. A blockage in the lining of the appendix that results in infection is the likely cause of appendicitis. The bacteria multiply rapidly, causing the appendix to become inflamed, swollen and filled with pus. If not treated promptly, the appendix can rupture. To help diagnose appendicitis, your doctor will likely take a history of your signs and symptoms and examine your abdomen. Tests and procedures used to diagnose appendicitis include: - Physical exam to assess your pain. Your doctor may apply gentle pressure on the painful area. When the pressure is suddenly released, appendicitis pain will often feel worse, signaling that the adjacent peritoneum is inflamed. Your doctor also may look for abdominal rigidity and a tendency for you to stiffen your abdominal muscles in response to pressure over the inflamed appendix (guarding). Your doctor may use a lubricated, gloved finger to examine your lower rectum (digital rectal exam). Women of childbearing age may be given a pelvic exam to check for possible gynecological problems that could be causing the pain. - Blood test. This allows your doctor to check for a high white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection. - Urine test. Your doctor may want you to have a urinalysis to make sure that a urinary tract infection or a kidney stone isn&apos;t causing your pain. - Imaging tests. Your doctor may also recommend an abdominal X-ray, an abdominal ultrasound or a computerized tomography (CT) scan to help confirm appendicitis or find other causes for your pain. Appendicitis treatment usually involves surgery to remove the inflamed appendix. Before surgery you may be given a dose of antibiotics to prevent infection. Surgery to remove the appendix (appendectomy) Appendectomy can be performed as open surgery using one abdominal incision about 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) long (laparotomy). Or the surgery can be done through a few small abdominal incisions (laparoscopic surgery). During a laparoscopic appendectomy, the surgeon inserts special surgical tools and a video camera into your abdomen to remove your appendix. In general, laparoscopic surgery allows you to recover faster and heal with less pain and scarring. It may be better for people who are elderly or obese. But laparoscopic surgery isn&apos;t appropriate for everyone. If your appendix has ruptured and infection has spread beyond the appendix or you have an abscess, you may need an open appendectomy, which allows your surgeon to clean the abdominal cavity. Expect to spend one or two days in the hospital after your appendectomy. Draining an abscess before appendix surgery If your appendix has burst and an abscess has formed around it, the abscess may be drained by placing a tube through your skin into the abscess. Appendectomy can be performed several weeks later after controlling the infection. Expect a few weeks of recovery from an appendectomy, or longer if your appendix burst. To help your body heal: - Avoid strenuous activity at first. If your appendectomy was done laparoscopically, limit your activity for three to five days. If you had an open appendectomy, limit your activity for 10 to 14 days. Always ask your doctor about limitations on your activity and when you can resume normal activities following surgery. - Support your abdomen when you cough. Place a pillow over your abdomen and apply pressure before you cough, laugh or move to help reduce pain. - Call your doctor if your pain medications aren&apos;t helping. Being in pain puts extra stress on your body and slows the healing process. If you&apos;re still in pain despite your pain medications, call your doctor. - Get up and move when you&apos;re ready. Start slowly and increase your activity as you feel up to it. Start with short walks. - Sleep when tired. As your body heals, you may find you feel sleepier than usual. Take it easy and rest when you need to. - Discuss returning to work or school with your doctor. You can return to work when you feel up to it. Children may be able to return to school less than a week after surgery. They should wait two to four weeks to resume strenuous activity, such as gym classes or sports. Your doctor will prescribe medications to help you control your pain after your appendectomy. Some complementary and alternative treatments, when used with your medications, can help control pain. Ask your doctor about safe options, such as: - Distracting activities, such as listening to music and talking with friends, that take your mind off your pain. Distraction can be especially effective with children. - Guided imagery, such as closing your eyes and thinking about a favorite place.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Appendicitis: Appendicitis is inflammation of your appendix. Appendicitis is inflammation of your appendix. In the United States, appendicitis is the most common cause of acute abdominal pain requiring surgery. Over 5% of the population develops appendicitis at some point.1 Appendicitis most commonly occurs in the teens and twenties but may occur at any age.1 If appendicitis is not treated, it may lead to complications. The complications of a ruptured appendix areperitonitis, which can be a dangerous condition. Peritonitis happens if your appendix bursts and infection spreads in your abdomen. If you have peritonitis, you may be very ill and have fever nausea severe tenderness in your abdomen vomiting an abscess of the appendix called an appendiceal abscess. The most common symptom of appendicitis is pain in your abdomen.If you have appendicitis, you’ll most often have pain in your abdomen thatbegins near your belly button and then moves lower and to your right gets worse in a matter of hours gets worse when you move around, take deep breaths, cough, or sneeze is severe and often described as different from any pain you’ve felt before occurs suddenly and may even wake you up if you’re sleeping occurs before other symptomsOther symptoms of appendicitis may includeloss of appetite nausea vomiting constipation or diarrhea an inability to pass gas a low-grade fever swelling in your abdomen the feeling that having a bowel movement will relieve discomfortSymptoms can be different for each person and can seem like the following conditions that also cause pain in the abdomen:abdominal adhesions constipation inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, long-lasting disorders that cause irritation and ulcers in the GI tract intestinal obstruction pelvic inflammatory disease The most common symptom of appendicitis is pain in your abdomen.If you have appendicitis, you’ll most often have pain in your abdomen thatbegins near your belly button and then moves lower and to your right gets worse in a matter of hours gets worse when you move around, take deep breaths, cough, or sneeze is severe and often described as different from any pain you’ve felt before occurs suddenly and may even wake you up if you’re sleeping occurs before other symptomsOther symptoms of appendicitis may includeloss of appetite nausea vomiting constipation or diarrhea an inability to pass gas a low-grade fever swelling in your abdomen the feeling that having a bowel movement will relieve discomfortSymptoms can be different for each person and can seem like the following conditions that also cause pain in the abdomen:abdominal adhesions constipation inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, long-lasting disorders that cause irritation and ulcers in the GI tract intestinal obstruction pelvic inflammatory disease Appendicitis can have more than one cause, and in many cases the cause is not clear. Possible causes include:Blockage of the opening inside the appendix enlarged tissue in the wall of your appendix, caused by infection in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or elsewhere in your body inflammatory bowel disease stool, parasites, or growths that can clog your appendiceal lumen trauma to your abdomen Appendicitis is a medical emergency that requires immediate care. See a health care professional or go to the emergency room right away if you think you or a child has appendicitis. A doctor can help treat the appendicitis and reduce symptoms and the chance of complications. Most often, health care professionals suspect the diagnosis of appendicitis based on your symptoms, your medical history, and a physical exam. A doctor can confirm the diagnosis with an ultrasound, x-ray, or MRI exam.A health care professional will ask specific questions about your symptoms and health history to help rule out other health problems. The health care professional will want to knowwhen your abdominal pain began the exact location and severity of your pain when your other symptoms appeared your other medical conditions, previous illnesses, and surgical procedures whether you use medicines, alcohol, or illegal drugsHealth care professionals need specific details about the pain in your abdomen to diagnose appendicitis correctly. A health care professional will assess your pain by touching or applying pressure to specific areas of your abdomen.The following responses to touch or pressure may indicate that you have appendicitis:Rovsing&apos;s sign Psoas sign Obturator sign Guarding Rebound tenderness Digital rectal exam Pelvic examDoctors use lab tests to help confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis or find other causes of abdominal pain.Blood tests. A health care professional draws your blood for a blood test at a doctor’s office or a commercial facility. The health care professional sends the blood sample to a lab for testing. Blood tests can show a high white blood cell count, a sign of infection. Blood tests also may show dehydration or fluid and electrolyte imbalances.Urinalysis. Urinalysis is testing of a urine sample. You will provide a urine sample in a special container in a doctor’s office, a commercial facility, or a hospital. Health care professionals can test the urine in the same location or send it to a lab for testing. Doctors use urinalysis to rule out a urinary tract infection or a kidney stone.Pregnancy test. For women, health care professionals also may order blood or urine samples to check for pregnancy.Doctors use imaging tests to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis or find other causes of pain in the abdomen.Abdominal ultrasound.

The radiation from CT scans can be harmful to a developing fetus. Doctors typically treat appendicitis with surgery to remove the appendix. Surgeons perform the surgery in a hospital with general anesthesia. Your doctor will recommend surgery if you have continuous abdominal pain and fever, or signs of a burst appendix and infection. Prompt surgery decreases the chance that your appendix will burst.Health care professionals call the surgery to remove the appendix an appendectomy. A surgeon performs the surgery using one of the following methods:Laparoscopic surgery. During laparoscopic surgery, surgeons use several smaller incisions and special surgical tools that they feed through the incisions to remove your appendix. Laparoscopic surgery leads to fewer complications, such as hospital-related infections, and has a shorter recovery time. Laparotomy. Surgeons use laparotomy to remove the appendix through a single incision in the lower right area of your abdomen.After surgery, most patients completely recover from appendicitis and don’t need to make changes to their diet, exercise, or lifestyle. Surgeons recommend that you limit physical activity for the first 10 to 14 days after a laparotomy and for the first 3 to 5 days after laparoscopic surgery.

In some cases, a surgeon finds a normal appendix during surgery. In this case, many surgeons will remove it to eliminate the future possibility of appendicitis. Sometimes surgeons find a different problem, which they may correct during surgery. Some cases of mild appendicitis may be cured with antibiotics alone. All patients suspected of having appendicitis are treated with antibiotics before surgery, and some patients may improve completely before surgery is performed. Treating the complications of a burst appendix will depend on the type of complication. In most cases of peritonitis, a surgeon will remove your appendix immediately with surgery. The surgeon will use laparotomy to clean the inside of your abdomen to prevent infection and then remove your appendix. Without prompt treatment, peritonitis can cause death.A surgeon may drain the pus from an appendiceal abscess during surgery or, more commonly, before surgery. To drain an abscess, the surgeon places a tube in the abscess through the abdominal wall. You leave the drainage tube in place for about 2 weeks while you take antibiotics to treat infection. When the infection and inflammation are under control, about 6 to 8 weeks later, surgeons operate to remove what remains of the burst appendix.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ear Infections in Children: An ear infection is an inflammation of the middle ear, usually caused by bacteria, that occurs when fluid builds up behind the eardrum. Anyone can get an ear infection, but children get them more often than adults. Five out of six children will have at least one ear infection by their third birthday. In fact, ear infections are the most common reason parents bring their child to a doctor. The scientific name for an ear infection is otitis media (OM). There are three main types of ear infections. Each has a different combination of symptoms. - Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common ear infection. Parts of the middle ear are infected and swollen and fluid is trapped behind the eardrum. This causes pain in the ear—commonly called an earache. Your child might also have a fever. - Otitis media with effusion (OME) sometimes happens after an ear infection has run its course and fluid stays trapped behind the eardrum. A child with OME may have no symptoms, but a doctor will be able to see the fluid behind the eardrum with a special instrument. - Chronic otitis media with effusion (COME) happens when fluid remains in the middle ear for a long time or returns over and over again, even though there is no infection. COME makes it harder for children to fight new infections and also can affect their hearing. Most ear infections happen to children before they’ve learned how to talk. If your child isn’t old enough to say “My ear hurts,” here are a few things to look for: - Tugging or pulling at the ear(s) - Fussiness and crying - Trouble sleeping - Fever (especially in infants and younger children) - Fluid draining from the ear - Clumsiness or problems with balance - Trouble hearing or responding to quiet sounds An ear infection usually is caused by bacteria and often begins after a child has a sore throat, cold, or other upper respiratory infection. If the upper respiratory infection is bacterial, these same bacteria may spread to the middle ear; if the upper respiratory infection is caused by a virus, such as a cold, bacteria may be drawn to the microbe-friendly environment and move into the middle ear as a secondary infection. Because of the infection, fluid builds up behind the eardrum. Parts of the ear The ear has three major parts: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. The outer ear, also called the pinna, includes everything we see on the outside—the curved flap of the ear leading down to the earlobe—but it also includes the ear canal, which begins at the opening to the ear and extends to the eardrum. The eardrum is a membrane that separates the outer ear from the middle ear.   The middle ear—which is where ear infections occur—is located between the eardrum and the inner ear. Within the middle ear are three tiny bones called the malleus, incus, and stapes that transmit sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear. The bones of the middle ear are surrounded by air. The inner ear contains the labyrinth, which help us keep our balance. The cochlea, a part of the labyrinth, is a snail-shaped organ that converts sound vibrations from the middle ear into electrical signals. The auditory nerve carries these signals from the cochlea to the brain. Other nearby parts of the ear also can be involved in ear infections. The eustachian tube is a small passageway that connects the upper part of the throat to the middle ear. Its job is to supply fresh air to the middle ear, drain fluid, and keep air pressure at a steady level between the nose and the ear. Adenoids are small pads of tissue located behind the back of the nose, above the throat, and near the eustachian tubes. Adenoids are mostly made up of immune system cells. They fight off infection by trapping bacteria that enter through the mouth. There are several reasons why children are more likely than adults to get ear infections. Eustachian tubes are smaller and more level in children than they are in adults. This makes it difficult for fluid to drain out of the ear, even under normal conditions. If the eustachian tubes are swollen or blocked with mucus due to a cold or other respiratory illness, fluid may not be able to drain. A child’s immune system isn’t as effective as an adult’s because it’s still developing. This makes it harder for children to fight infections. As part of the immune system, the adenoids respond to bacteria passing through the nose and mouth. Sometimes bacteria get trapped in the adenoids, causing a chronic infection that can then pass on to the eustachian tubes and the middle ear. The first thing a doctor will do is ask you about your child’s health. Has your child had a head cold or sore throat recently? Is he having trouble sleeping? Is she pulling at her ears? If an ear infection seems likely, the simplest way for a doctor to tell is to use a lighted instrument, called an otoscope, to look at the eardrum. A red, bulging eardrum indicates an infection. A doctor also may use a pneumatic otoscope, which blows a puff of air into the ear canal, to check for fluid behind the eardrum. A normal eardrum will move back and forth more easily than an eardrum with fluid behind it. Tympanometry, which uses sound tones and air pressure, is a diagnostic test a doctor might use if the diagnosis still isn’t clear. A tympanometer is a small, soft plug that contains a tiny microphone and speaker as well as a device that varies air pressure in the ear. It measures how flexible the eardrum is at different pressures. Many doctors will prescribe an antibiotic, such as amoxicillin, to be taken over seven to 10 days. Your doctor also may recommend over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, or eardrops, to help with fever and pain. (Because aspirin is considered a major preventable risk factor for Reye’s syndrome, a child who has a fever or other flu-like symptoms should not be given aspirin unless instructed to by your doctor.) If your doctor isn’t able to make a definite diagnosis of OM and your child doesn’t have severe ear pain or a fever, your doctor might ask you to wait a day or two to see if the earache goes away. The American Academy of Pediatrics issued guidelines in 2013 that encourage doctors to observe and closely follow these children with ear infections that can’t be definitively diagnosed, especially those between the ages of 6 months to 2 years. If there’s no improvement within 48 to 72 hours from when symptoms began, the guidelines recommend doctors start antibiotic therapy. Sometimes ear pain isn’t caused by infection, and some ear infections may get better without antibiotics. Using antibiotics cautiously and with good reason helps prevent the development of bacteria that become resistant to antibiotics. If your doctor prescribes an antibiotic, it’s important to make sure your child takes it exactly as prescribed and for the full amount of time. Even though your child may seem better in a few days, the infection still hasn’t completely cleared from the ear. Stopping the medicine too soon could allow the infection to come back. It’s also important to return for your child’s follow-up visit, so that the doctor can check if the infection is gone. Your child should start feeling better within a few days after visiting the doctor. If it’s been several days and your child still seems sick, call your doctor. Your child might need a different antibiotic. Once the infection clears, fluid may still remain in the middle ear but usually disappears within three to six weeks. To keep a middle ear infection from coming back, it helps to limit some of the factors that might put your child at risk, such as not being around people who smoke and not going to bed with a bottle. In spite of these precautions, some children may continue to have middle ear infections, sometimes as many as five or six a year. Your doctor may want to wait for several months to see if things get better on their own but, if the infections keep coming back and antibiotics aren’t helping, many doctors will recommend a surgical procedure that places a small ventilation tube in the eardrum to improve air flow and prevent fluid backup in the middle ear. The most commonly used tubes stay in place for six to nine months and require follow-up visits until they fall out. If placement of the tubes still doesn’t prevent infections, a doctor may consider removing the adenoids to prevent infection from spreading to the eustachian tubes. Currently, the best way to prevent ear infections is to reduce the risk factors associated with them. Here are some things you might want to do to lower your child’s risk for ear infections. - Vaccinate your child against the flu. Make sure your child gets the influenza, or flu, vaccine every year. - It is recommended that you vaccinate your child with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). The PCV13 protects against more types of infection-causing bacteria than the previous vaccine, the PCV7. If your child already has begun PCV7 vaccination, consult your physician about how to transition to PCV13. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that children under age 2 be vaccinated, starting at 2 months of age. Studies have shown that vaccinated children get far fewer ear infections than children who aren’t vaccinated. The vaccine is strongly recommended for children in daycare. - Wash hands frequently. Washing hands prevents the spread of germs and can help keep your child from catching a cold or the flu. - Avoid exposing your baby to cigarette smoke. Studies have shown that babies who are around smokers have more ear infections. - Never put your baby down for a nap, or for the night, with a bottle. - Don’t allow sick children to spend time together. As much as possible, limit your child’s exposure to other children when your child or your child’s playmates are sick. Researchers sponsored by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) are exploring many areas to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of middle ear infections. For example, finding better ways to predict which children are at higher risk of developing an ear infection could lead to successful prevention tactics. Another area that needs exploration is why some children have more ear infections than others. For example, Native American and Hispanic children have more infections than do children in other ethnic groups. What kinds of preventive measures could be taken to lower the risks? Doctors also are beginning to learn more about what happens in the ears of children who have recurring ear infections. They have identified colonies of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, called biofilms, that are present in the middle ears of most children with chronic ear infections. Understanding how to attack and kill these biofilms would be one way to successfully treat chronic ear infections and avoid surgery. Understanding the impact that ear infections have on a child’s speech and language development is another important area of study. Creating more accurate methods to diagnose middle ear infections would help doctors prescribe more targeted treatments. Researchers also are evaluating drugs currently being used to treat ear infections, and developing new, more effective and easier ways to administer medicines. NIDCD-supported investigators continue to explore vaccines against some of the most common bacteria and viruses that cause middle ear infections, such as nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and Moraxella catarrhalis. One team is conducting studies on a method for delivering a possible vaccine without a needle.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ear Infections in Children (What research is being done on middle ear infections?): Researchers sponsored by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) are exploring many areas to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of middle ear infections. For example, finding better ways to predict which children are at higher risk of developing an ear infection could lead to successful prevention tactics. Another area that needs exploration is why some children have more ear infections than others. For example, Native American and Hispanic children have more infections than do children in other ethnic groups. What kinds of preventive measures could be taken to lower the risks? Doctors also are beginning to learn more about what happens in the ears of children who have recurring ear infections. They have identified colonies of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, called biofilms, that are present in the middle ears of most children with chronic ear infections. Understanding how to attack and kill these biofilms would be one way to successfully treat chronic ear infections and avoid surgery. Understanding the impact that ear infections have on a child’s speech and language development is another important area of study. Creating more accurate methods to diagnose middle ear infections would help doctors prescribe more targeted treatments. Researchers also are evaluating drugs currently being used to treat ear infections, and developing new, more effective and easier ways to administer medicines. NIDCD-supported investigators continue to explore vaccines against some of the most common bacteria and viruses that cause middle ear infections, such as nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and Moraxella catarrhalis.

				<AnswerText>Ear Infections in Children (What happens if my child keeps getting ear infections?): To keep a middle ear infection from coming back, it helps to limit some of the factors that might put your child at risk, such as not being around people who smoke and not going to bed with a bottle. In spite of these precautions, some children may continue to have middle ear infections, sometimes as many as five or six a year. Your doctor may want to wait for several months to see if things get better on their own but, if the infections keep coming back and antibiotics aren’t helping, many doctors will recommend a surgical procedure that places a small ventilation tube in the eardrum to improve air flow and prevent fluid backup in the middle ear. The most commonly used tubes stay in place for six to nine months and require follow-up visits until they fall out. If placement of the tubes still doesn’t prevent infections, a doctor may consider removing the adenoids to prevent infection from spreading to the eustachian tubes.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ear Infections in Children (Why are children more likely than adults to get ear infections?): There are several reasons why children are more likely than adults to get ear infections. Eustachian tubes are smaller and more level in children than they are in adults. This makes it difficult for fluid to drain out of the ear, even under normal conditions. If the eustachian tubes are swollen or blocked with mucus due to a cold or other respiratory illness, fluid may not be able to drain. A child’s immune system isn’t as effective as an adult’s because it’s still developing. This makes it harder for children to fight infections. As part of the immune system, the adenoids respond to bacteria passing through the nose and mouth.

				<AnswerText>Ear Infections in Children (What are the symptoms of an ear infection?): There are three main types of ear infections. Each has a different combination of symptoms. - Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common ear infection. Parts of the middle ear are infected and swollen and fluid is trapped behind the eardrum. This causes pain in the ear—commonly called an earache. Your child might also have a fever. - Otitis media with effusion (OME) sometimes happens after an ear infection has run its course and fluid stays trapped behind the eardrum. A child with OME may have no symptoms, but a doctor will be able to see the fluid behind the eardrum with a special instrument. - Chronic otitis media with effusion (COME) happens when fluid remains in the middle ear for a long time or returns over and over again, even though there is no infection. COME makes it harder for children to fight new infections and also can affect their hearing.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ear Infections in Children (How is an acute middle ear infection treated?): Many doctors will prescribe an antibiotic, such as amoxicillin, to be taken over seven to 10 days. Your doctor also may recommend over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, or eardrops, to help with fever and pain. (Because aspirin is considered a major preventable risk factor for Reye’s syndrome, a child who has a fever or other flu-like symptoms should not be given aspirin unless instructed to by your doctor.) If your doctor isn’t able to make a definite diagnosis of OM and your child doesn’t have severe ear pain or a fever, your doctor might ask you to wait a day or two to see if the earache goes away. The American Academy of Pediatrics issued guidelines in 2013 that encourage doctors to observe and closely follow these children with ear infections that can’t be definitively diagnosed, especially those between the ages of 6 months to 2 years. If there’s no improvement within 48 to 72 hours from when symptoms began, the guidelines recommend doctors start antibiotic therapy. Sometimes ear pain isn’t caused by infection, and some ear infections may get better without antibiotics. Using antibiotics cautiously and with good reason helps prevent the development of bacteria that become resistant to antibiotics. If your doctor prescribes an antibiotic, it’s important to make sure your child takes it exactly as prescribed and for the full amount of time. Even though your child may seem better in a few days, the infection still hasn’t completely cleared from the ear. Stopping the medicine too soon could allow the infection to come back. It’s also important to return for your child’s follow-up visit, so that the doctor can check if the infection is gone.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What are Ear Infections?: Ear infections are the most common reason parents bring their child to a doctor. Three out of four children will have at least one ear infection by their third birthday. Adults can also get ear infections, but they are less common. The infection usually affects the middle ear and is called otitis media. The tubes inside the ears become clogged with fluid and mucus. This can affect hearing, because sound cannot get through all that fluid. If your child isn&apos;t old enough to say &quot;My ear hurts,&quot; here are a few things to look for - Tugging at ears - Crying more than usual - Fluid draining from the ear - Trouble sleeping - Balance difficulties - Hearing problems Your health care provider will diagnose an ear infection by looking inside the ear with an instrument called an otoscope. Often, ear infections go away on their own. Your health care provider may recommend pain relievers. Severe infections and infections in young babies may require antibiotics. Children who get infections often may need surgery to place small tubes inside their ears. The tubes relieve pressure in the ears so that the child can hear again.

				<AnswerText>Ear Infections in Children (Can ear infections be prevented?): Currently, the best way to prevent ear infections is to reduce the risk factors associated with them. Here are some things you might want to do to lower your child’s risk for ear infections. - Vaccinate your child against the flu. Make sure your child gets the influenza, or flu, vaccine every year. - It is recommended that you vaccinate your child with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). The PCV13 protects against more types of infection-causing bacteria than the previous vaccine, the PCV7. If your child already has begun PCV7 vaccination, consult your physician about how to transition to PCV13. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that children under age 2 be vaccinated, starting at 2 months of age. Studies have shown that vaccinated children get far fewer ear infections than children who aren’t vaccinated. The vaccine is strongly recommended for children in daycare. - Wash hands frequently. Washing hands prevents the spread of germs and can help keep your child from catching a cold or the flu. - Avoid exposing your baby to cigarette smoke. Studies have shown that babies who are around smokers have more ear infections. - Never put your baby down for a nap, or for the night, with a bottle. - Don’t allow sick children to spend time together.

				<AnswerText>What are the treatments for Ear infection - acute?: Some ear infections clear on their own without antibiotics. Often, treating the pain and allowing the body time to heal itself is all that is needed: - Apply a warm cloth or warm water bottle to the affected ear. - Use over-the-counter pain relief drops for ears. Or, ask the provider about prescription eardrops to relieve pain. - Take over-the-counter medicines such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain or fever. Do NOT give aspirin to children. All children younger than 6 months with a fever or symptoms of an ear infection should see a provider. Children who are older than 6 months may be watched at home if they do NOT have: - A fever higher than 102F (38.9C) - More severe pain or other symptoms - Other medical problems If there is no improvement or if symptoms get worse, schedule an appointment with the provider to determine whether antibiotics are needed. ANTIBIOTICS A virus or bacteria can cause ear infections. Antibiotics will not help an infection that is caused by a virus. Most providers don&apos;t prescribe antibiotics for every ear infection. However, all children younger than 6 months with an ear infection are treated with antibiotics. Your health care provider is more likely to prescribe antibiotics if your child: - Is under age 2 - Has a fever - Appears sick - Does not improve in 24 to 48 hours If antibiotics are prescribed, it is important to take them every day and to take all of the medicine. Do NOT stop the medicine when symptoms go away. If the antibiotics do not seem to be working within 48 to 72 hours, contact your provider. You may need to switch to a different antibiotic. Side effects of antibiotics may include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Although rare, serious allergic reactions may also occur. Some children have repeat ear infections that seem to go away between episodes. They may receive a smaller, daily dose of antibiotics to prevent new infections. SURGERY If an infection does not go away with the usual medical treatment, or if a child has many ear infections over a short period of time, the provider may recommend ear tubes: - A tiny tube is inserted into the eardrum, keeping open a small hole that allows air to get in so fluids can drain more easily. - Usually the tubes fall out by themselves. Those that don&apos;t fall out may be removed in the provider&apos;s office. If the adenoids are enlarged, removing them with surgery may be considered if ear infections continue to occur. Removing tonsils does not seem to help prevent ear infections.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ear Infections in Children: An ear infection is an inflammation of the middle ear, usually caused by bacteria, that occurs when fluid builds up behind the eardrum. Anyone can get an ear infection, but children get them more often than adults. Five out of six children will have at least one ear infection by their third birthday. In fact, ear infections are the most common reason parents bring their child to a doctor. The scientific name for an ear infection is otitis media (OM). There are three main types of ear infections. Each has a different combination of symptoms. - Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common ear infection. Parts of the middle ear are infected and swollen and fluid is trapped behind the eardrum. This causes pain in the ear—commonly called an earache. Your child might also have a fever. - Otitis media with effusion (OME) sometimes happens after an ear infection has run its course and fluid stays trapped behind the eardrum. A child with OME may have no symptoms, but a doctor will be able to see the fluid behind the eardrum with a special instrument. - Chronic otitis media with effusion (COME) happens when fluid remains in the middle ear for a long time or returns over and over again, even though there is no infection. COME makes it harder for children to fight new infections and also can affect their hearing. Most ear infections happen to children before they’ve learned how to talk. If your child isn’t old enough to say “My ear hurts,” here are a few things to look for: - Tugging or pulling at the ear(s) - Fussiness and crying - Trouble sleeping - Fever (especially in infants and younger children) - Fluid draining from the ear - Clumsiness or problems with balance - Trouble hearing or responding to quiet sounds An ear infection usually is caused by bacteria and often begins after a child has a sore throat, cold, or other upper respiratory infection. If the upper respiratory infection is bacterial, these same bacteria may spread to the middle ear; if the upper respiratory infection is caused by a virus, such as a cold, bacteria may be drawn to the microbe-friendly environment and move into the middle ear as a secondary infection. Because of the infection, fluid builds up behind the eardrum. Parts of the ear The ear has three major parts: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. The outer ear, also called the pinna, includes everything we see on the outside—the curved flap of the ear leading down to the earlobe—but it also includes the ear canal, which begins at the opening to the ear and extends to the eardrum. The eardrum is a membrane that separates the outer ear from the middle ear.   The middle ear—which is where ear infections occur—is located between the eardrum and the inner ear. Within the middle ear are three tiny bones called the malleus, incus, and stapes that transmit sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear. The bones of the middle ear are surrounded by air. The inner ear contains the labyrinth, which help us keep our balance. The cochlea, a part of the labyrinth, is a snail-shaped organ that converts sound vibrations from the middle ear into electrical signals. The auditory nerve carries these signals from the cochlea to the brain. Other nearby parts of the ear also can be involved in ear infections. The eustachian tube is a small passageway that connects the upper part of the throat to the middle ear. Its job is to supply fresh air to the middle ear, drain fluid, and keep air pressure at a steady level between the nose and the ear. Adenoids are small pads of tissue located behind the back of the nose, above the throat, and near the eustachian tubes. Adenoids are mostly made up of immune system cells. They fight off infection by trapping bacteria that enter through the mouth. There are several reasons why children are more likely than adults to get ear infections. Eustachian tubes are smaller and more level in children than they are in adults. This makes it difficult for fluid to drain out of the ear, even under normal conditions. If the eustachian tubes are swollen or blocked with mucus due to a cold or other respiratory illness, fluid may not be able to drain. A child’s immune system isn’t as effective as an adult’s because it’s still developing. This makes it harder for children to fight infections. As part of the immune system, the adenoids respond to bacteria passing through the nose and mouth. Sometimes bacteria get trapped in the adenoids, causing a chronic infection that can then pass on to the eustachian tubes and the middle ear. The first thing a doctor will do is ask you about your child’s health. Has your child had a head cold or sore throat recently? Is he having trouble sleeping? Is she pulling at her ears? If an ear infection seems likely, the simplest way for a doctor to tell is to use a lighted instrument, called an otoscope, to look at the eardrum. A red, bulging eardrum indicates an infection. A doctor also may use a pneumatic otoscope, which blows a puff of air into the ear canal, to check for fluid behind the eardrum. A normal eardrum will move back and forth more easily than an eardrum with fluid behind it. Tympanometry, which uses sound tones and air pressure, is a diagnostic test a doctor might use if the diagnosis still isn’t clear. A tympanometer is a small, soft plug that contains a tiny microphone and speaker as well as a device that varies air pressure in the ear. It measures how flexible the eardrum is at different pressures. Many doctors will prescribe an antibiotic, such as amoxicillin, to be taken over seven to 10 days. Your doctor also may recommend over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, or eardrops, to help with fever and pain. (Because aspirin is considered a major preventable risk factor for Reye’s syndrome, a child who has a fever or other flu-like symptoms should not be given aspirin unless instructed to by your doctor.) If your doctor isn’t able to make a definite diagnosis of OM and your child doesn’t have severe ear pain or a fever, your doctor might ask you to wait a day or two to see if the earache goes away. The American Academy of Pediatrics issued guidelines in 2013 that encourage doctors to observe and closely follow these children with ear infections that can’t be definitively diagnosed, especially those between the ages of 6 months to 2 years. If there’s no improvement within 48 to 72 hours from when symptoms began, the guidelines recommend doctors start antibiotic therapy. Sometimes ear pain isn’t caused by infection, and some ear infections may get better without antibiotics. Using antibiotics cautiously and with good reason helps prevent the development of bacteria that become resistant to antibiotics. If your doctor prescribes an antibiotic, it’s important to make sure your child takes it exactly as prescribed and for the full amount of time. Even though your child may seem better in a few days, the infection still hasn’t completely cleared from the ear. Stopping the medicine too soon could allow the infection to come back. It’s also important to return for your child’s follow-up visit, so that the doctor can check if the infection is gone. Your child should start feeling better within a few days after visiting the doctor. If it’s been several days and your child still seems sick, call your doctor. Your child might need a different antibiotic. Once the infection clears, fluid may still remain in the middle ear but usually disappears within three to six weeks. To keep a middle ear infection from coming back, it helps to limit some of the factors that might put your child at risk, such as not being around people who smoke and not going to bed with a bottle. In spite of these precautions, some children may continue to have middle ear infections, sometimes as many as five or six a year. Your doctor may want to wait for several months to see if things get better on their own but, if the infections keep coming back and antibiotics aren’t helping, many doctors will recommend a surgical procedure that places a small ventilation tube in the eardrum to improve air flow and prevent fluid backup in the middle ear. The most commonly used tubes stay in place for six to nine months and require follow-up visits until they fall out. If placement of the tubes still doesn’t prevent infections, a doctor may consider removing the adenoids to prevent infection from spreading to the eustachian tubes. Currently, the best way to prevent ear infections is to reduce the risk factors associated with them. Here are some things you might want to do to lower your child’s risk for ear infections. - Vaccinate your child against the flu. Make sure your child gets the influenza, or flu, vaccine every year. - It is recommended that you vaccinate your child with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). The PCV13 protects against more types of infection-causing bacteria than the previous vaccine, the PCV7. If your child already has begun PCV7 vaccination, consult your physician about how to transition to PCV13. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that children under age 2 be vaccinated, starting at 2 months of age. Studies have shown that vaccinated children get far fewer ear infections than children who aren’t vaccinated. The vaccine is strongly recommended for children in daycare. - Wash hands frequently. Washing hands prevents the spread of germs and can help keep your child from catching a cold or the flu. - Avoid exposing your baby to cigarette smoke. Studies have shown that babies who are around smokers have more ear infections. - Never put your baby down for a nap, or for the night, with a bottle. - Don’t allow sick children to spend time together. As much as possible, limit your child’s exposure to other children when your child or your child’s playmates are sick. Researchers sponsored by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) are exploring many areas to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of middle ear infections. For example, finding better ways to predict which children are at higher risk of developing an ear infection could lead to successful prevention tactics. Another area that needs exploration is why some children have more ear infections than others. For example, Native American and Hispanic children have more infections than do children in other ethnic groups. What kinds of preventive measures could be taken to lower the risks? Doctors also are beginning to learn more about what happens in the ears of children who have recurring ear infections. They have identified colonies of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, called biofilms, that are present in the middle ears of most children with chronic ear infections. Understanding how to attack and kill these biofilms would be one way to successfully treat chronic ear infections and avoid surgery. Understanding the impact that ear infections have on a child’s speech and language development is another important area of study. Creating more accurate methods to diagnose middle ear infections would help doctors prescribe more targeted treatments. Researchers also are evaluating drugs currently being used to treat ear infections, and developing new, more effective and easier ways to administer medicines. NIDCD-supported investigators continue to explore vaccines against some of the most common bacteria and viruses that cause middle ear infections, such as nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and Moraxella catarrhalis. One team is conducting studies on a method for delivering a possible vaccine without a needle.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>What are Ear Infections?: Ear infections are the most common reason parents bring their child to a doctor. Three out of four children will have at least one ear infection by their third birthday. Adults can also get ear infections, but they are less common. The infection usually affects the middle ear and is called otitis media. The tubes inside the ears become clogged with fluid and mucus. This can affect hearing, because sound cannot get through all that fluid. If your child isn&apos;t old enough to say &quot;My ear hurts,&quot; here are a few things to look for - Tugging at ears - Crying more than usual - Fluid draining from the ear - Trouble sleeping - Balance difficulties - Hearing problems Your health care provider will diagnose an ear infection by looking inside the ear with an instrument called an otoscope. Often, ear infections go away on their own. Your health care provider may recommend pain relievers. Severe infections and infections in young babies may require antibiotics. Children who get infections often may need surgery to place small tubes inside their ears. The tubes relieve pressure in the ears so that the child can hear again.

				<AnswerText>Ear infection (middle ear) (Diagnosis): Your doctor can usually diagnose an ear infection or another condition based on the symptoms you describe and an exam. The doctor will likely use a lighted instrument (an otoscope) to look at the ears, throat and nasal passage. He or she will also likely listen to your child breathe with a stethoscope. Pneumatic otoscope An instrument called a pneumatic otoscope is often the only specialized tool a doctor needs to make a diagnosis of an ear infection. This instrument enables the doctor to look in the ear and judge whether there is fluid behind the eardrum. With the pneumatic otoscope, the doctor gently puffs air against the eardrum. Normally, this puff of air would cause the eardrum to move. If the middle ear is filled with fluid, your doctor will observe little to no movement of the eardrum. Additional tests Your doctor may perform other diagnostic tests if there is any doubt about a diagnosis, if the condition hasn&apos;t responded to previous treatments, or if there are other persistent or serious problems. - Tympanometry. This test measures the movement of the eardrum. The device, which seals off the ear canal, adjusts air pressure in the canal, thereby causing the eardrum to move. The device quantifies how well the eardrum moves and provides an indirect measure of pressure within the middle ear. - Acoustic reflectometry. This test measures how much sound emitted from a device is reflected back from the eardrum - an indirect measure of fluids in the middle ear. Normally, the eardrum absorbs most of the sound. However, the more pressure there is from fluid in the middle ear, the more sound the eardrum will reflect. - Tympanocentesis. Rarely, a doctor may use a tiny tube that pierces the eardrum to drain fluid from the middle ear - a procedure called tympanocentesis. Tests to determine the infectious agent in the fluid may be beneficial if an infection hasn&apos;t responded well to previous treatments. - Other tests. If your child has had persistent ear infections or persistent fluid buildup in the middle ear, your doctor may refer you to a hearing specialist (audiologist), speech therapist or developmental therapist for tests of hearing, speech skills, language comprehension or developmental abilities. What a diagnosis means - Acute otitis media. The diagnosis of &quot;ear infection&quot; is generally shorthand for acute otitis media. Your doctor likely makes this diagnosis if he or she observes signs of fluid in the middle ear, if there are signs or symptoms of an infection, and if the onset of symptoms was relatively sudden. - Otitis media with effusion. If the diagnosis is otitis media with effusion, the doctor has found evidence of fluid in the middle ear, but there are presently no signs or symptoms of infection. - Chronic suppurative otitis media. If the doctor makes a diagnosis of chronic suppurative otitis media, he or she has found that a persistent ear infection resulted in tearing or perforation of the eardrum.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Cervical cancer: Cervical cancer is cancer that starts in the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the routine use of Pap smears. Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are 2 types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar. Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells. Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia. This condition can be detected by a Pap smear and is 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap smears, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap smear results. Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical cancer. Other strains can cause genital warts. Others do not cause any problems at all. A woman&apos;s sexual habits and patterns can increase her risk of developing cervical cancer. Risky sexual practices include: - Having sex at an early age - Having multiple sexual partners - Having a partner or many partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities Other risk factors for cervical cancer include: - Not getting the HPV vaccine - Being economically disadvantaged - Having a mother who took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy in the early 1960s to prevent miscarriage - Having a weakened immune system Most of the time, early cervical cancer has no symptoms. Symptoms that may occur include: - Abnormal vaginal bleeding between periods, after intercourse, or after menopause - Vaginal discharge that does not stop, and may be pale, watery, pink, brown, bloody, or foul-smelling - Periods that become heavier and last longer than usual Cervical cancer may spread to the bladder, intestines, lungs, and liver. Often, there are no problems until the cancer is advanced and has spread. Symptoms of advanced cervical cancer may include: - Back pain - Bone pain or fractures - Fatigue - Leaking of urine or feces from the vagina - Leg pain - Loss of appetite - Pelvic pain - Single swollen leg - Weight loss Precancerous changes of the cervix and cervical cancer cannot be seen with the naked eye. Special tests and tools are needed to spot such conditions: - A Pap smear screens for precancers and cancer, but does not make a final diagnosis. - The human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test may be done along with a Pap test. Or it may be used after a woman has had an abnormal Pap test result. It may also be used as the first test. - If abnormal changes are found, the cervix is usually examined under magnification. This procedure is called colposcopy. Pieces of tissue are removed (biopsied) during this procedure. This tissue is then sent to a lab for examination. - A procedure called a cone biopsy may also be done. If cervical cancer is diagnosed, the health care provider will order more tests. These help determine how far the cancer has spread. This is called staging. Tests may include: - Chest x-ray - CT scan of the pelvis - Cystoscopy - Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) - MRI of the pelvis Treatment of cervical cancer depends on: - The stage of the cancer - The size and shape of the tumor - The woman&apos;s age and general health - Her desire to have children in the future Early cervical cancer can be cured by removing or destroying the precancerous or cancerous tissue. This is why routine Pap smears are so important to prevent cervical cancer. There are surgical ways to do this without removing the uterus or damaging the cervix, so that a woman can still have children in the future. Types of surgery for early cervical cancer include: - Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP): Uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue - Cryotherapy: Freezes abnormal cells - Laser therapy: Uses light to burn abnormal tissue A hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus but not the ovaries) is not often done for cervical cancer that has not spread. It may be done in women who have had repeated LEEP procedures. Treatment for more advanced cervical cancer may include: - Radical hysterectomy, which removes the uterus and much of the surrounding tissues, including lymph nodes and the upper part of the vagina. - Pelvic exenteration, an extreme type of surgery in which all of the organs of the pelvis, including the bladder and rectum, are removed. Radiation may be used to treat cancer that has spread beyond the cervix or cancer that has returned. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer. It may be given alone or with surgery or radiation. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. How well the person does depends on many things, including: - Type of cervical cancer - Stage of cancer (how far it has spread) - Age and general health - If the cancer comes back after treatment Precancerous conditions can be completely cured when followed up and treated properly. Most women are alive in 5 years (5-year survival rate) for cancer that has spread to the inside of the cervix walls but not outside the cervix area. The 5-year survival rate falls as the cancer spreads outside the walls of the cervix into other areas. Complications can include: - Risk of the cancer coming back in women who have treatment to save the uterus - Problems with sexual, bowel, and bladder function after surgery or radiation Call your provider if you: - Have not had regular Pap smears - Have abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge Cervical cancer can be prevented by doing the following: - Get the HPV vaccine. The vaccine prevents most types of HPV infection that cause cervical cancer. Your provider can tell you if the vaccine is right for you. - Practice safer sex. Using condoms during sex reduces the risk for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). - Limit the number of sexual partners you have. Avoid partners who are active in high-risk sexual behaviors. - Get Pap smears as often as your provider recommends. Pap smears can help detect early changes, which can be treated before they turn into cervical cancer. - Get the HPV test if recommended by your provider. It can be used along with the Pap test to screen for cervical cancer in women 30 years and older. - If you smoke, quit. Smoking increases your chance of getting cervical cancer.

				<AnswerText>Cervical Cancer: The cervix is the lower, narrow end of the uterus (the organ where a fetus grows). The cervix leads from the uterus to the vagina (birth canal). The main types of cervical cancer are squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma begins in the thin, flat cells that line the cervix. Adenocarcinoma begins in cervical cells that make mucus and other fluids. Long-lasting infections with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) cause almost all cases of cervical cancer. Vaccines that protect against infection with these types of HPV can greatly reduce the risk of cervical cancer. Having a Pap test to check for abnormal cells in the cervix or a test to check for HPV can find cells that may become cervical cancer. These cells can be treated before cancer forms. Cervical cancer can usually be cured if it is found and treated in the early stages. - Cervical cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the cervix. - Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the major risk factor for cervical cancer. - There are usually no signs or symptoms of early cervical cancer but it can be detected early with regular check-ups. - Signs and symptoms of cervical cancer include vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. - Tests that examine the cervix are used to detect (find) and diagnose cervical cancer. - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. - Cervical cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the cervix. - Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the major risk factor for cervical cancer. - There are usually no signs or symptoms of early cervical cancer but it can be detected early with regular check-ups. - Signs and symptoms of cervical cancer include vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. - Tests that examine the cervix are used to detect (find) and diagnose cervical cancer. - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. - After cervical cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the cervix or to other parts of the body. - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - The following stages are used for cervical cancer: - Carcinoma in Situ (Stage 0) - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - After cervical cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the cervix or to other parts of the body. - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - The following stages are used for cervical cancer: - Carcinoma in Situ (Stage 0) - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - There are different types of treatment for patients with cervical cancer. - Four types of standard treatment are used: - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Targeted therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Treatment for cervical cancer may cause side effects. - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. - There are different types of treatment for patients with cervical cancer. - Four types of standard treatment are used: - Surgery - Radiation therapy - Chemotherapy - Targeted therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Treatment for cervical cancer may cause side effects. - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed.

General Information About Cervical Cancer During Pregnancy Treatment of cervical cancer during pregnancy depends on the stage of the cancer and how long the patient has been pregnant. A biopsy and imaging tests may be done to determine the stage of the disease. To avoid exposing the fetus to radiation, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is used. Treatment Options for Cervical Cancer During Pregnancy For information about the treatments listed below, see the Treatment Option Overview section. Carcinoma in Situ (Stage 0) During Pregnancy Usually, no treatment is needed for carcinoma in situ (stage 0) during pregnancy. A colposcopy may be done to check for invasive cancer. Stage I Cervical Cancer During Pregnancy Pregnant women with slow-growing stage I cervical cancer may be able to delay treatment until the second trimester of pregnancy or after delivery. Pregnant women with fast-growing stage I cervical cancer may need immediate treatment. Treatment may include: - Conization. - Radical trachelectomy. Women should be tested to find out if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. If cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, immediate treatment may be needed. Stage II, III, and IV Cervical Cancer During Pregnancy Treatment for stage II, stage III, and stage IV cervical cancer during pregnancy may include the following: - Chemotherapy to shrink the tumor in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Surgery or radiation therapy may be done after delivery. - Radiation therapy plus chemotherapy. Talk with your doctor about the effects of radiation on the fetus.

				<AnswerText>Cervical cancer (Causes): Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the routine use of Pap smears. Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are 2 types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar. Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells. Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia. This condition can be detected by a Pap smear and is 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap smears, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap smear results. Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV.

				<AnswerText>Cervical cancer (Causes): Cervical cancer begins when healthy cells acquire a genetic change (mutation) that causes them to turn into abnormal cells. Healthy cells grow and multiply at a set rate, eventually dying at a set time. Cancer cells grow and multiply out of control, and they don&apos;t die. The accumulating abnormal cells form a mass (tumor). Cancer cells invade nearby tissues and can break off from a tumor to spread (metastasize) elsewhere in the body. It isn&apos;t clear what causes cervical cancer, but it&apos;s certain that HPV plays a role. HPV is very common, and most women with the virus never develop cervical cancer. This means other factors - such as your environment or your lifestyle choices - also determine whether you&apos;ll develop cervical cancer. The type of cervical cancer that you have helps determine your prognosis and treatment. The main types of cervical cancer are: - Squamous cell carcinoma. This type of cervical cancer begins in the thin, flat cells (squamous cells) lining the outer part of the cervix, which projects into the vagina. Most cervical cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. - Adenocarcinoma. This type of cervical cancer begins in the column-shaped glandular cells that line the cervical canal. Sometimes, both types of cells are involved in cervical cancer. Very rarely, cancer occurs in other cells in the cervix.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Cervical cancer: Cervical cancer is cancer that starts in the cervix, the lower, narrow part of the uterus (womb). Most cervical cancers are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Cervical cancer is the easiest gynecological cancer to prevent with regular screening tests and vaccination. It is also very curable when found and treated early. Learn more about cervical cancer at the National Cancer Institute. Cervical cancer is cancer that starts in the cervix, the lower, narrow part of the uterus. It happens when the body&apos;s cervical cells divide very fast and grow out of control. These extra cells form a tumor. Each year, about 12,000 women in the United States get cervical cancer. Cervical cancer happens most often in women 30 years or older, but all women are at risk. Most cases of cervical cancer are caused by a high-risk type of HPV. HPV is a virus that is passed from person to person through genital contact, such as vaginal, anal, or oral sex. If the HPV infection does not go away on its own, it may cause cervical cancer over time. Other things may increase the risk of developing cancer following a high-risk HPV infection. These other things include: You may not notice any signs or symptoms of cervical cancer. Signs of advanced cervical cancer may include bleeding or discharge from the vagina. These symptoms may not be caused by cervical cancer, but the only way to be sure is to see your doctor. Women should start getting screened at age 21. You can get a Pap test to look for changes in cervical cells that could become cancer-ous if not treated. If the Pap test finds major changes in the cells of the cervix, your doctor may suggest more tests to look for cancer. Women between the ages of 30 and 65 can also get an HPV test with your Pap test to see if you have HPV. The Pap test and the HPV test look for different things. A Pap test checks the cervix for abnormal cell changes that, if not found and treated, can lead to cervical cancer. Your doctor takes cells from your cervix to examine under a microscope. How often you need a Pap test depends on your age and health history. Talk with your doctor about what is best for you. Learn more about Pap tests on our Pap test page. An HPV test looks for HPV on a woman&apos;s cervix. Certain types of HPV can lead to cervical cancer. Your doctor will swab the cervix for cells. An HPV test is not the same as the HPV vaccine. According to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), women ages 30 to 65 can combine the HPV test with a Pap test every 5 years. The USPSTF does not recommend the HPV test for women under age 30. Learn more about HPV and the HPV test on our HPV page. How often you need to be screened depends on your age and health history. Talk with your doctor about what is best for you. Most women can follow these guidelines: If you had a hysterectomy, you should follow these guidelines: You can lower your risk of getting cervical cancer with the following steps. The steps work best when used together. No single step can protect you from cervical cancer. The best ways to prevent cervical cancer include: HPV vaccines are approved for girls and young women from 9 through 26. Experts recommend that all girls get an HPV vaccine before any sexual activity, by the time they are 11 or 12. The Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine gives the most protection against cervical cancer for girls and women. Some girls younger than 15 may be able to get just two doses of the HPV vaccine, but others may need three doses of the HPV vaccine. The HPV vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women. Talk to your doctor to find out how many doses are best for you. Yes. You can still benefit from the HPV vaccine if you have already had sexual contact before getting all three doses. This only applies if you have not been infected with the HPV types included in the vaccine.

				<AnswerText>Cervical cancer: Cervical cancer is cancer that starts in the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the routine use of Pap smears. Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are 2 types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar. Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells. Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia. This condition can be detected by a Pap smear and is 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap smears, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap smear results. Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical cancer. Other strains can cause genital warts. Others do not cause any problems at all. A woman&apos;s sexual habits and patterns can increase her risk of developing cervical cancer. Risky sexual practices include: - Having sex at an early age - Having multiple sexual partners - Having a partner or many partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities Other risk factors for cervical cancer include: - Not getting the HPV vaccine - Being economically disadvantaged - Having a mother who took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy in the early 1960s to prevent miscarriage - Having a weakened immune system Most of the time, early cervical cancer has no symptoms. Symptoms that may occur include: - Abnormal vaginal bleeding between periods, after intercourse, or after menopause - Vaginal discharge that does not stop, and may be pale, watery, pink, brown, bloody, or foul-smelling - Periods that become heavier and last longer than usual Cervical cancer may spread to the bladder, intestines, lungs, and liver. Often, there are no problems until the cancer is advanced and has spread. Symptoms of advanced cervical cancer may include: - Back pain - Bone pain or fractures - Fatigue - Leaking of urine or feces from the vagina - Leg pain - Loss of appetite - Pelvic pain - Single swollen leg - Weight loss Precancerous changes of the cervix and cervical cancer cannot be seen with the naked eye. Special tests and tools are needed to spot such conditions: - A Pap smear screens for precancers and cancer, but does not make a final diagnosis. - The human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test may be done along with a Pap test. Or it may be used after a woman has had an abnormal Pap test result. It may also be used as the first test. - If abnormal changes are found, the cervix is usually examined under magnification. This procedure is called colposcopy. Pieces of tissue are removed (biopsied) during this procedure. This tissue is then sent to a lab for examination. - A procedure called a cone biopsy may also be done. If cervical cancer is diagnosed, the health care provider will order more tests. These help determine how far the cancer has spread. This is called staging. Tests may include: - Chest x-ray - CT scan of the pelvis - Cystoscopy - Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) - MRI of the pelvis Treatment of cervical cancer depends on: - The stage of the cancer - The size and shape of the tumor - The woman&apos;s age and general health - Her desire to have children in the future Early cervical cancer can be cured by removing or destroying the precancerous or cancerous tissue. This is why routine Pap smears are so important to prevent cervical cancer. There are surgical ways to do this without removing the uterus or damaging the cervix, so that a woman can still have children in the future. Types of surgery for early cervical cancer include: - Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP): Uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue - Cryotherapy: Freezes abnormal cells - Laser therapy: Uses light to burn abnormal tissue A hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus but not the ovaries) is not often done for cervical cancer that has not spread. It may be done in women who have had repeated LEEP procedures. Treatment for more advanced cervical cancer may include: - Radical hysterectomy, which removes the uterus and much of the surrounding tissues, including lymph nodes and the upper part of the vagina. - Pelvic exenteration, an extreme type of surgery in which all of the organs of the pelvis, including the bladder and rectum, are removed. Radiation may be used to treat cancer that has spread beyond the cervix or cancer that has returned. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer. It may be given alone or with surgery or radiation. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. How well the person does depends on many things, including: - Type of cervical cancer - Stage of cancer (how far it has spread) - Age and general health - If the cancer comes back after treatment Precancerous conditions can be completely cured when followed up and treated properly. Most women are alive in 5 years (5-year survival rate) for cancer that has spread to the inside of the cervix walls but not outside the cervix area. The 5-year survival rate falls as the cancer spreads outside the walls of the cervix into other areas. Complications can include: - Risk of the cancer coming back in women who have treatment to save the uterus - Problems with sexual, bowel, and bladder function after surgery or radiation Call your provider if you: - Have not had regular Pap smears - Have abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge Cervical cancer can be prevented by doing the following: - Get the HPV vaccine. The vaccine prevents most types of HPV infection that cause cervical cancer. Your provider can tell you if the vaccine is right for you. - Practice safer sex. Using condoms during sex reduces the risk for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). - Limit the number of sexual partners you have. Avoid partners who are active in high-risk sexual behaviors. - Get Pap smears as often as your provider recommends. Pap smears can help detect early changes, which can be treated before they turn into cervical cancer. - Get the HPV test if recommended by your provider. It can be used along with the Pap test to screen for cervical cancer in women 30 years and older. - If you smoke, quit. Smoking increases your chance of getting cervical cancer.

				<AnswerText>Cervical cancer (Treatment): Treatment for cervical cancer depends on several factors, such as the stage of the cancer, other health problems you may have and your preferences. Surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or a combination of the three may be used. Surgery Early-stage cervical cancer is typically treated with surgery to remove the uterus (hysterectomy). A hysterectomy can cure early-stage cervical cancer and prevent recurrence. But removing the uterus makes it impossible to become pregnant. Your doctor may recommend: - Simple hysterectomy. The cervix and uterus are removed along with the cancer. Simple hysterectomy is usually an option only in very early-stage cervical cancer. - Radical hysterectomy. The cervix, uterus, part of the vagina and lymph nodes in the area are removed with the cancer. Minimally invasive surgery may be an option for early-stage cervical cancer. Surgery that preserves the possibility of becoming pregnant also may be an option, if you have very early-stage cervical cancer without lymph node involvement. Radiation Radiation therapy uses high-powered energy beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy may be used alone or with chemotherapy before surgery to shrink a tumor or after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells. Radiation therapy can be given: - Externally, by directing a radiation beam at the affected area of the body (external beam radiation therapy) - Internally, by placing a device filled with radioactive material inside your vagina, usually for only a few minutes (brachytherapy) - Both externally and internally Premenopausal women may stop menstruating and begin menopause as a result of radiation therapy. If you might want to get pregnant after radiation treatment, ask your doctor about ways to preserve your eggs before treatment starts. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses medications, usually injected into a vein, to kill cancer cells. Low doses of chemotherapy are often combined with radiation therapy, since chemotherapy may enhance the effects of the radiation. Higher doses of chemotherapy are used to control advanced cervical cancer that may not be curable. Follow-up care After you complete treatment, your doctor will recommend regular checkups. Ask your doctor how often you should have follow-up exams. Supportive (palliative) care Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care. When palliative care is used along with all of the other appropriate treatments, people with cancer may feel better and live longer. Palliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. Palliative care teams aim to improve the quality of life for people with cancer and their families. This form of care is offered alongside curative or other treatments you may be receiving.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Cervical cancer (Diagnosis): Screening Cervical cancer that is detected early is more likely to be treated successfully. Most guidelines suggest that women begin screening for cervical cancer and precancerous changes at age 21. Screening tests include: - Pap test. During a Pap test, your doctor scrapes and brushes cells from your cervix, which are then examined in a lab for abnormalities. A Pap test can detect abnormal cells in the cervix, including cancer cells and cells that show changes that increase the risk of cervical cancer. - HPV DNA test. The HPV DNA test involves testing cells collected from the cervix for infection with any of the types of HPV that are most likely to lead to cervical cancer. This test may be an option for women age 30 and older, or for younger women with an abnormal Pap test. Diagnosis If cervical cancer is suspected, your doctor is likely to start with a thorough examination of your cervix. A special magnifying instrument (colposcope) is used to check for abnormal cells. During the colposcopic examination, your doctor is likely to take a sample of cervical cells (biopsy) for laboratory testing. To obtain tissue, your doctor may use: - Punch biopsy, which involves using a sharp tool to pinch off small samples of cervical tissue. - Endocervical curettage, which uses a small, spoon-shaped instrument (curet) or a thin brush to scrape a tissue sample from the cervix. If the punch biopsy or endocervical curettage is worrisome, your doctor may perform one of the following tests: - Electrical wire loop, which uses a thin, low-voltage electrical wire to obtain a small tissue sample. Generally this is done under local anesthesia in the office. - Cone biopsy, which is a procedure that allows your doctor to obtain deeper layers of cervical cells for laboratory testing. A cone biopsy may be done in a hospital under general anesthesia. Staging If your doctor determines that you have cervical cancer, you&apos;ll have further tests to determine the extent (stage) of your cancer. Your cancer&apos;s stage is a key factor in deciding on your treatment. Staging exams include: - Imaging tests. Tests such as X-rays, CT scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) help your doctor determine whether your cancer has spread beyond your cervix. - Visual examination of your bladder and rectum. Your doctor may use special scopes to see inside your bladder and rectum. Stages of cervical cancer include: - Stage I. Cancer is confined to the cervix. - Stage II. Cancer is present in the cervix and upper portion of the vagina. - Stage III. Cancer has moved to the lower portion of the vagina or internally to the pelvic side wall. - Stage IV. Cancer has spread to nearby organs, such as the bladder or rectum, or it has spread to other areas of the body, such as the lungs, liver or bones.</AnswerText>

Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are 2 types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar. Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells.

Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap smears, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap smear results. Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical cancer. Other strains can cause genital warts. Others do not cause any problems at all. A woman&apos;s sexual habits and patterns can increase her risk of developing cervical cancer. Risky sexual practices include: - Having sex at an early age - Having multiple sexual partners - Having a partner or many partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities Other risk factors for cervical cancer include: - Not getting the HPV vaccine - Being economically disadvantaged - Having a mother who took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy in the early 1960s to prevent miscarriage - Having a weakened immune system Most of the time, early cervical cancer has no symptoms. Symptoms that may occur include: - Abnormal vaginal bleeding between periods, after intercourse, or after menopause - Vaginal discharge that does not stop, and may be pale, watery, pink, brown, bloody, or foul-smelling - Periods that become heavier and last longer than usual Cervical cancer may spread to the bladder, intestines, lungs, and liver. Often, there are no problems until the cancer is advanced and has spread. Symptoms of advanced cervical cancer may include: - Back pain - Bone pain or fractures - Fatigue - Leaking of urine or feces from the vagina - Leg pain - Loss of appetite - Pelvic pain - Single swollen leg - Weight loss Precancerous changes of the cervix and cervical cancer cannot be seen with the naked eye. Special tests and tools are needed to spot such conditions: - A Pap smear screens for precancers and cancer, but does not make a final diagnosis. - The human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test may be done along with a Pap test. Or it may be used after a woman has had an abnormal Pap test result. It may also be used as the first test. - If abnormal changes are found, the cervix is usually examined under magnification. This procedure is called colposcopy. Pieces of tissue are removed (biopsied) during this procedure. This tissue is then sent to a lab for examination. - A procedure called a cone biopsy may also be done. If cervical cancer is diagnosed, the health care provider will order more tests. These help determine how far the cancer has spread. This is called staging. Tests may include: - Chest x-ray - CT scan of the pelvis - Cystoscopy - Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) - MRI of the pelvis Treatment of cervical cancer depends on: - The stage of the cancer - The size and shape of the tumor - The woman&apos;s age and general health - Her desire to have children in the future Early cervical cancer can be cured by removing or destroying the precancerous or cancerous tissue. This is why routine Pap smears are so important to prevent cervical cancer. There are surgical ways to do this without removing the uterus or damaging the cervix, so that a woman can still have children in the future. Types of surgery for early cervical cancer include: - Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP): Uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue - Cryotherapy: Freezes abnormal cells - Laser therapy: Uses light to burn abnormal tissue A hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus but not the ovaries) is not often done for cervical cancer that has not spread. It may be done in women who have had repeated LEEP procedures. Treatment for more advanced cervical cancer may include: - Radical hysterectomy, which removes the uterus and much of the surrounding tissues, including lymph nodes and the upper part of the vagina. - Pelvic exenteration, an extreme type of surgery in which all of the organs of the pelvis, including the bladder and rectum, are removed. Radiation may be used to treat cancer that has spread beyond the cervix or cancer that has returned. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer. It may be given alone or with surgery or radiation. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. How well the person does depends on many things, including: - Type of cervical cancer - Stage of cancer (how far it has spread) - Age and general health - If the cancer comes back after treatment Precancerous conditions can be completely cured when followed up and treated properly. Most women are alive in 5 years (5-year survival rate) for cancer that has spread to the inside of the cervix walls but not outside the cervix area. The 5-year survival rate falls as the cancer spreads outside the walls of the cervix into other areas. Complications can include: - Risk of the cancer coming back in women who have treatment to save the uterus - Problems with sexual, bowel, and bladder function after surgery or radiation Call your provider if you: - Have not had regular Pap smears - Have abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge Cervical cancer can be prevented by doing the following: - Get the HPV vaccine. The vaccine prevents most types of HPV infection that cause cervical cancer. Your provider can tell you if the vaccine is right for you. - Practice safer sex. Using condoms during sex reduces the risk for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). - Limit the number of sexual partners you have. Avoid partners who are active in high-risk sexual behaviors. - Get Pap smears as often as your provider recommends. Pap smears can help detect early changes, which can be treated before they turn into cervical cancer. - Get the HPV test if recommended by your provider. It can be used along with the Pap test to screen for cervical cancer in women 30 years and older. - If you smoke, quit. Smoking increases your chance of getting cervical cancer.

				<AnswerText>Ovarian cancer: Ovarian cancer is cancer that begins in the ovaries. The ovaries make female hormones and produce a woman&apos;s eggs. Ovarian cancer is a serious cancer that is more common in older women. Treatment is most effective when the cancer is found early. Screening for ovarian cancer is not recommended for most women. Learn more about ovarian cancer at the National Cancer Institute. Ovarian cancer forms in tissues of the ovary. (An ovary is one of a pair of female reproductive glands in which the ova, or eggs, are formed.) Tumors in the ovaries can be benign, which means they are not cancer, or they can be malignant, which means they are cancer. Cancers that start in the ovaries can spread to other parts of the body. This is called metastasis. Cancer that starts in the ovaries and spreads to other parts of the body is still called ovarian cancer. Around one in every 60 women in the United States will develop ovarian cancer. Most ovarian cancers are diagnosed in women over 60, but this disease can also affect younger women. Among women in the United States, ovarian cancer is rare. Most ovarian cancers are diagnosed among women ages 55 to 64, but ovarian cancer can also affect younger women. Women with a high risk of ovarian cancer are those with a harmful mutation on the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. These mutations can be found with a blood test. Women with a family or personal history of breast or ovarian cancer also have a higher risk of ovarian cancer. If you have family members in multiple generations with breast cancer or ovarian cancer, see your doctor to learn more about your risk of ovarian cancer. Research shows that certain steps, such as surgery to remove the ovaries and the fallopian tubes, may help prevent ovarian cancer in women who are at high risk. The sooner ovarian cancer is found and treated, the better your chance for recovery. But ovarian cancer is hard to detect early, because its symptoms are also the symptoms of many other illnesses. The following may be symptoms of ovarian cancer if they continue or get worse over time: If you have any of these symptoms, talk to your doctor. He or she can determine if the cause is cancer or something else. Your doctor also may ask you to visit a gynecologic oncologist. This is a doctor who focuses on cancers of the female pelvis. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against screening women who are not at high risk for ovarian cancer. The USPSTF found that testing for ovarian cancer may do more harm than good. Current testing methods, like pelvic exams, ultrasound, and blood tests, can lead to &quot;false positives&quot; (results that say a woman has ovarian cancer when she really does not have ovarian cancer). These incorrect results can lead to surgeries that are not needed and that can be risky. Some women, like those who are at high risk, can talk to their doctor about their risk and what they can do to help prevent ovarian cancer.

				<AnswerText>How to diagnose Ovarian cancer?: A physical exam is often normal. With advanced ovarian cancer, the doctor may find a swollen abdomen often due to accumulation of fluid (ascites). A pelvic examination may reveal an ovarian or abdominal mass. A CA-125 blood test is not considered a good screening test for ovarian cancer. But, it may be done if a woman has: - Symptoms of ovarian cancer - Already been diagnosed with ovarian cancer to determine how well treatment is working Other tests that may be done include: - Complete blood count and blood chemistry - Pregnancy test (serum HCG) - CT or MRI of the pelvis or abdomen - Ultrasound of the pelvis Surgery, such as a pelvic laparoscopy or exploratory laparotomy, is often done to find the cause of symptoms. A biopsy will be done to help make the diagnosis. No lab or imaging test has ever been shown to be able to successfully screen for or diagnose ovarian cancer in its early stages, so no standard screening tests are recommended at this time.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ovarian cancer: Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the ovaries. The female reproductive system contains two ovaries, one on each side of the uterus. The ovaries - each about the size of an almond - produce eggs (ova) as well as the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Ovarian cancer often goes undetected until it has spread within the pelvis and abdomen. At this late stage, ovarian cancer is more difficult to treat and is frequently fatal. Early-stage ovarian cancer, in which the disease is confined to the ovary, is more likely to be treated successfully. Surgery and chemotherapy are generally used to treat ovarian cancer. Early-stage ovarian cancer rarely causes any symptoms. Advanced-stage ovarian cancer may cause few and nonspecific symptoms that are often mistaken for more common benign conditions. Signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer may include: - Abdominal bloating or swelling - Quickly feeling full when eating - Weight loss - Discomfort in the pelvis area - Changes in bowel habits, such as constipation - A frequent need to urinate When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms that worry you. If you have a family history of ovarian cancer or breast cancer, talk to your doctor about your risk of ovarian cancer. Your doctor may refer you to a genetic counselor to discuss testing for certain gene mutations that increase your risk of breast and ovarian cancers. It&apos;s not clear what causes ovarian cancer, though doctors have identified factors that can increase the risk of the disease. In general, cancer begins when a cell develops errors (mutations) in its DNA. The mutations tell the cell to grow and multiply quickly, creating a mass (tumor) of abnormal cells. The abnormal cells continue living when healthy cells would die. They can invade nearby tissues and break off from an initial tumor to spread elsewhere in the body (metastasize). Types of ovarian cancer The type of cell where the cancer begins determines the type of ovarian cancer you have. Ovarian cancer types include: - Epithelial tumors, which begin in the thin layer of tissue that covers the outside of the ovaries. About 90 percent of ovarian cancers are epithelial tumors. - Stromal tumors, which begin in the ovarian tissue that contains hormone-producing cells. These tumors are usually diagnosed at an earlier stage than other ovarian tumors. About 7 percent of ovarian tumors are stromal. - Germ cell tumors, which begin in the egg-producing cells. These rare ovarian cancers tend to occur in younger women. Factors that can increase your risk of ovarian cancer include: - Older age. Ovarian cancer can occur at any age but is most common in women ages 50 to 60 years. - Inherited gene mutations. A small percentage of ovarian cancers are caused by gene mutations you inherit from your parents. The genes known to increase the risk of ovarian cancer are called breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer gene 2 (BRCA2). These genes also increase the risk of breast cancer. Other gene mutations, including those associated with Lynch syndrome, are known to increase the risk of ovarian cancer. - Family history of ovarian cancer. People with two or more close relatives with ovarian cancer have an increased risk of the disease. - Estrogen hormone replacement therapy, especially with long-term use and in large doses. - Age when menstruation started and ended. Beginning menstruation at an early age or starting menopause at a later age, or both, may increase the risk of ovarian cancer. Tests and procedures used to diagnose ovarian cancer include: - Pelvic exam. During a pelvic exam, your doctor inserts gloved fingers into your vagina and simultaneously presses a hand on your abdomen in order to feel (palpate) your pelvic organs. The doctor also visually examines your external genitalia, vagina and cervix. - Imaging tests. Tests, such as ultrasound or CT scans of your abdomen and pelvis, may help determine the size, shape and structure of your ovaries. - Blood tests. Blood tests might include organ function tests that can help determine your overall health. Your doctor might also test your blood for tumor markers that indicate ovarian cancer. For example, a cancer antigen (CA) 125 test can detect a protein that&apos;s often found on the surface of ovarian cancer cells. These tests can&apos;t tell your doctor whether you have cancer, but may give clues about your diagnosis and prognosis. - Surgery. Sometimes your doctor can&apos;t be certain of your diagnosis until you undergo surgery to remove an ovary and have it tested for signs of cancer. Once it&apos;s confirmed that you have ovarian cancer, your doctor will use information from your tests and procedures to assign your cancer a stage. The stages of ovarian cancer are indicated using Roman numerals ranging from I to IV, with the lowest stage indicating that the cancer is confined to the ovaries. By stage IV, the cancer has spread to distant areas of the body. Treatment of ovarian cancer usually involves a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Surgery Operations to remove ovarian cancer include: - Surgery to remove one ovary. For very early stage cancer that hasn&apos;t spread beyond one ovary, surgery may involve removing the affected ovary and its fallopian tube. This procedure may preserve your ability to have children. - Surgery to remove both ovaries. If cancer is present in both your ovaries, but there are no signs of additional cancer, your surgeon may remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes. This procedure leaves your uterus intact, so you may still be able to become pregnant using your own frozen embryos or eggs or with eggs from a donor. - Surgery to remove both ovaries and the uterus. If your cancer is more extensive or if you don&apos;t wish to preserve your ability to have children, your surgeon will remove the ovaries, the fallopian tubes, the uterus, nearby lymph nodes and a fold of fatty abdominal tissue (omentum). - Surgery for advanced cancer. If your cancer is advanced, your doctor may recommend chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that uses chemicals to kill fast-growing cells in the body, including cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs can be injected into a vein or taken by mouth. Sometimes the drugs are injected directly into the abdomen (intraperitoneal chemotherapy). Chemotherapy is often used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that might remain. It can also be used before surgery. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy uses medications that target the specific vulnerabilities present within your cancer cells. Targeted therapy drugs are usually reserved for treating ovarian cancer that returns after initial treatment or cancer that resists other treatments. Your doctor may test your cancer cells to determine which targeted therapy is most likely to have an effect on your cancer. Targeted therapy is an active area of cancer research. Many clinical trials are testing new targeted therapies. Supportive (palliative) care Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care. Palliative care can be used while undergoing other aggressive treatments, such as surgery and chemotherapy. When palliative care is used along with all of the other appropriate treatments, people with cancer may feel better and live longer. Palliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. Palliative care teams aim to improve the quality of life for people with cancer and their families. This form of care is offered alongside curative or other treatments you may be receiving.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ovarian cancer: Ovarian cancer is a form of cancer that occurs due to abnormal and uncontrolled cell growth in the ovaries. Many people with early ovarian cancer have no signs or symptoms of the condition. When present, symptoms are often nonspecific and blamed on other, more common conditions. Most cases of ovarian cancer occur sporadically in people with little to no family history of the condition; however, approximately 10-25% of ovarian cancers are thought to be &quot;hereditary.&quot; Although the underlying genetic cause of some hereditary cases is unknown, many are part of a hereditary cancer syndrome (such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, Lynch syndrome and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome) and are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. [1] [2] The best treatment options for ovarian cancer depend on many factors including the subtype and stage of the condition, but may include surgery, chemotherapy , radiation therapy , and/or targeted therapy (such as monoclonal antibody therapy). [3] [4] [5] Many people with early ovarian cancer have no signs or symptoms of the condition. When present, symptoms are often nonspecific and blamed on other, more common conditions. Some people with ovarian cancer may experience the following: [2] [6] Bloating Difficulty eating or early satiety Pelvic or lower abdominal pain Back pain Abnormal vaginal bleeding Digestive symptoms such as nausea and vomiting; constipation; indigestion; and/or acid reflux Weight loss or weight gain Increased urinary frequency or urgency Tiredness Shortness of breath The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Breast carcinoma - Dysgerminoma - Ovarian papillary adenocarcinoma - Most cases of ovarian cancer occur sporadically in people with little to no family history of the condition. They are due to random changes ( mutations ) that occur only in the cells of the ovary. These mutations (called somatic mutations ) accumulate during a person&apos;s lifetime and are not inherited or passed on to future generations. [1] However, approximately 10-25% of ovarian cancers are thought to be &quot;hereditary.&quot; These cases are caused by an inherited predisposition to ovarian cancer that is passed down through a family. In some of these families, the underlying genetic cause is not known. However, many of these cases are part of a hereditary cancer syndrome . For example, the following cancer syndromes are associated with an elevated risk of ovarian cancer and several other types of cancer: [1] Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome due to mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene is the most common known cause of hereditary ovarian cancer. Lynch syndrome is caused by mutations in the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or EPCAM gene Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is caused by mutations in the STK11 gene Of note, some research suggests that inherited mutations in several other genes (including BARD1 , BRIP1, MRE11A, NBN, RAD51, RAD50, CHEK2, and PALB2) may also be associated with an increased risk for ovarian cancer. However, the risk associated with many of these genes is not well understood. Most are termed &quot;moderate- or low-penetrant&quot; genes which means that, on their own, they would be expected to have a relatively small effect on ovarian cancer risk. However, in combination with other genes and/or environmental factors , these genes may lead to a significant risk of ovarian cancer. [7] Most cases of ovarian cancer occur sporadically in people with little to no family history of the condition. However, approximately 10-25% of ovarian cancer is thought to be inherited . In some of these families, the underlying genetic cause is not known. However, many of these cases are part of a hereditary cancer syndrome such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, Lynch syndrome and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, which are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. [1] This means that a person only needs a change ( mutation ) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell to have a hereditary predisposition to ovarian cancer and other cancers associated with these syndromes. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new ( de novo) mutations in the gene. A person with one of these syndromes has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child. If ovarian cancer is suspected based on the presence of certain signs and symptoms, the following tests and procedures may be recommended: [2] [6] Physical evaluation and pelvic exam to check for signs of ovarian cancer (i.e. lumps or swelling) and to examine the size, shape and location of the ovaries Ultrasound and other imaging studies to look for abnormal growths Blood tests such as a CA-125 assay which may be elevated in people with ovarian cancer A biopsy of the tumor is the only way to confirm a diagnosis of ovarian cancer The National Cancer Institute offers more detailed information regarding the tests used to diagnose ovarian cancer. To access this resource, please click here. Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. The best treatment options for ovarian cancer depend on many factors including the subtype and stage of the condition. In general, treatment may include a combination of the following:[3][4][5] Surgery to remove the ovaries, the fallopian tubes, the uterus, and/or other structures in the belly (pelvis). Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Targeted therapy (such as monoclonal antibody therapy) Unfortunately, research suggests that there are no benefits of ovarian cancer  screening (using a CA-125 blood test and transvaginal ultrasound), even in women who are at an elevated risk due to their personal and/or family histories.[8] Women who are at a high-risk for ovarian cancer may, therefore, want to discuss other preventative measures, such as prophylactic surgery, with their healthcare provider. In women with a known hereditary cancer syndrome , management should also include screening for the other component cancers.

In general, epithelial ovarian cancers (the most common subtype) are often associated with a worse prognosis than more rare subtypes such as germ cell and stromal ovarian tumors . [3] [4] [5] Because early stages of ovarian cancer are often not associated with any specific signs or symptoms, many cases are, unfortunately, diagnosed at a later and less treatable stage. Late stage ovarian cancers are generally associated with a poor prognosis. For example, 5-year survival rates for women diagnosed with stage I ovarian cancer range from 79-87%, while the 5-year survival rates for women diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer are approximately 11%.

The sooner ovarian cancer is found and treated, the better your chance for recovery. But ovarian cancer is hard to detect early, because its symptoms are also the symptoms of many other illnesses. The following may be symptoms of ovarian cancer if they continue or get worse over time: If you have any of these symptoms, talk to your doctor. He or she can determine if the cause is cancer or something else. Your doctor also may ask you to visit a gynecologic oncologist. This is a doctor who focuses on cancers of the female pelvis. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against screening women who are not at high risk for ovarian cancer. The USPSTF found that testing for ovarian cancer may do more harm than good. Current testing methods, like pelvic exams, ultrasound, and blood tests, can lead to &quot;false positives&quot; (results that say a woman has ovarian cancer when she really does not have ovarian cancer). These incorrect results can lead to surgeries that are not needed and that can be risky. Some women, like those who are at high risk, can talk to their doctor about their risk and what they can do to help prevent ovarian cancer.

				<AnswerText>How to diagnose Ovarian cancer?: A physical exam is often normal. With advanced ovarian cancer, the doctor may find a swollen abdomen often due to accumulation of fluid (ascites). A pelvic examination may reveal an ovarian or abdominal mass. A CA-125 blood test is not considered a good screening test for ovarian cancer. But, it may be done if a woman has: - Symptoms of ovarian cancer - Already been diagnosed with ovarian cancer to determine how well treatment is working Other tests that may be done include: - Complete blood count and blood chemistry - Pregnancy test (serum HCG) - CT or MRI of the pelvis or abdomen - Ultrasound of the pelvis Surgery, such as a pelvic laparoscopy or exploratory laparotomy, is often done to find the cause of symptoms. A biopsy will be done to help make the diagnosis. No lab or imaging test has ever been shown to be able to successfully screen for or diagnose ovarian cancer in its early stages, so no standard screening tests are recommended at this time.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ovarian cancer (Risk factors): Factors that can increase your risk of ovarian cancer include: - Older age. Ovarian cancer can occur at any age but is most common in women ages 50 to 60 years. - Inherited gene mutations. A small percentage of ovarian cancers are caused by gene mutations you inherit from your parents. The genes known to increase the risk of ovarian cancer are called breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer gene 2 (BRCA2). These genes also increase the risk of breast cancer. Other gene mutations, including those associated with Lynch syndrome, are known to increase the risk of ovarian cancer. - Family history of ovarian cancer. People with two or more close relatives with ovarian cancer have an increased risk of the disease. - Estrogen hormone replacement therapy, especially with long-term use and in large doses. - Age when menstruation started and ended. Beginning menstruation at an early age or starting menopause at a later age, or both, may increase the risk of ovarian cancer.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ovarian cancer (Overview): Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the ovaries. The female reproductive system contains two ovaries, one on each side of the uterus. The ovaries - each about the size of an almond - produce eggs (ova) as well as the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Ovarian cancer often goes undetected until it has spread within the pelvis and abdomen. At this late stage, ovarian cancer is more difficult to treat and is frequently fatal. Early-stage ovarian cancer, in which the disease is confined to the ovary, is more likely to be treated successfully. Surgery and chemotherapy are generally used to treat ovarian cancer.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ovarian cancer (Causes): It&apos;s not clear what causes ovarian cancer, though doctors have identified factors that can increase the risk of the disease. In general, cancer begins when a cell develops errors (mutations) in its DNA. The mutations tell the cell to grow and multiply quickly, creating a mass (tumor) of abnormal cells. The abnormal cells continue living when healthy cells would die. They can invade nearby tissues and break off from an initial tumor to spread elsewhere in the body (metastasize). Types of ovarian cancer The type of cell where the cancer begins determines the type of ovarian cancer you have. Ovarian cancer types include: - Epithelial tumors, which begin in the thin layer of tissue that covers the outside of the ovaries. About 90 percent of ovarian cancers are epithelial tumors. - Stromal tumors, which begin in the ovarian tissue that contains hormone-producing cells. These tumors are usually diagnosed at an earlier stage than other ovarian tumors. About 7 percent of ovarian tumors are stromal. - Germ cell tumors, which begin in the egg-producing cells. These rare ovarian cancers tend to occur in younger women.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ovarian cancer: Ovarian cancer is cancer that begins in the ovaries. The ovaries make female hormones and produce a woman&apos;s eggs. Ovarian cancer is a serious cancer that is more common in older women. Treatment is most effective when the cancer is found early. Screening for ovarian cancer is not recommended for most women. Learn more about ovarian cancer at the National Cancer Institute. Ovarian cancer forms in tissues of the ovary. (An ovary is one of a pair of female reproductive glands in which the ova, or eggs, are formed.) Tumors in the ovaries can be benign, which means they are not cancer, or they can be malignant, which means they are cancer. Cancers that start in the ovaries can spread to other parts of the body. This is called metastasis. Cancer that starts in the ovaries and spreads to other parts of the body is still called ovarian cancer. Around one in every 60 women in the United States will develop ovarian cancer. Most ovarian cancers are diagnosed in women over 60, but this disease can also affect younger women. Among women in the United States, ovarian cancer is rare. Most ovarian cancers are diagnosed among women ages 55 to 64, but ovarian cancer can also affect younger women. Women with a high risk of ovarian cancer are those with a harmful mutation on the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. These mutations can be found with a blood test.

				<AnswerText>Ovarian cancer (Treatment): Treatment of ovarian cancer usually involves a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Surgery Operations to remove ovarian cancer include: - Surgery to remove one ovary. For very early stage cancer that hasn&apos;t spread beyond one ovary, surgery may involve removing the affected ovary and its fallopian tube. This procedure may preserve your ability to have children. - Surgery to remove both ovaries. If cancer is present in both your ovaries, but there are no signs of additional cancer, your surgeon may remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes. This procedure leaves your uterus intact, so you may still be able to become pregnant using your own frozen embryos or eggs or with eggs from a donor. - Surgery to remove both ovaries and the uterus. If your cancer is more extensive or if you don&apos;t wish to preserve your ability to have children, your surgeon will remove the ovaries, the fallopian tubes, the uterus, nearby lymph nodes and a fold of fatty abdominal tissue (omentum). - Surgery for advanced cancer. If your cancer is advanced, your doctor may recommend chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that uses chemicals to kill fast-growing cells in the body, including cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs can be injected into a vein or taken by mouth. Sometimes the drugs are injected directly into the abdomen (intraperitoneal chemotherapy). Chemotherapy is often used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that might remain. It can also be used before surgery. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy uses medications that target the specific vulnerabilities present within your cancer cells. Targeted therapy drugs are usually reserved for treating ovarian cancer that returns after initial treatment or cancer that resists other treatments. Your doctor may test your cancer cells to determine which targeted therapy is most likely to have an effect on your cancer. Targeted therapy is an active area of cancer research. Many clinical trials are testing new targeted therapies. Supportive (palliative) care Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care. Palliative care can be used while undergoing other aggressive treatments, such as surgery and chemotherapy. When palliative care is used along with all of the other appropriate treatments, people with cancer may feel better and live longer. Palliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. Palliative care teams aim to improve the quality of life for people with cancer and their families. This form of care is offered alongside curative or other treatments you may be receiving.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Cancer treatments (Summary): If you have cancer, your doctor will recommend one or more ways to treat the disease. The most common treatments are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Newer options include targeted therapy, immunotherapy, laser hormonal therapy, and others. Here is an overview of the different treatments for cancer and how they work. Surgery Surgery is a common treatment for many types of cancer. During the operation, the surgeon takes out the mass of cancerous cells (tumor) and some of the nearby tissue. Sometimes, surgery is done to relieve side effects caused by a tumor. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy refers to drugs used to kill cancer cells. The drugs may be given by mouth, a shot, or into a blood vessel (IV). Different types of drugs may be given together at the same time or one after the other. Radiation Radiation therapy uses x-rays, particles, or radioactive seeds to kill cancer cells. Cancer cells grow and divide faster than normal cells in the body. Because radiation is most harmful to quickly growing cells, radiation therapy damages cancer cells more than normal cells. This prevents the cancer cells from growing and dividing, and leads to cell death. The two main types of radiation therapy are: - External beam. This is the most common form. It aims x-rays or particles at the tumor from outside the body. - Internal beam. This form delivers radiation inside your body. It may be given by radioactive seeds placed into or near the tumor; a liquid or pill that you swallow; or through a vein (intravenous, or IV). Targeted Therapies Targeted therapy uses drugs to stops cancer from growing and spreading. It does this with less harm to normal cells than other treatments. Standard chemotherapy works by killing cancer cells and some normal cells. Targeted treatment zeroes in on specific targets (molecules) in cancer cells. These targets play a role in how cancer cells grow and survive. Using these targets, the drug disables the cancer cells so they cannot spread. Targeted therapy drugs work in a few different ways. They may: - Turn off the process in cancer cells that causes them to grow and spread - Trigger cancer cells to die on their own - Kill cancer cells directly Targeted therapies are given as a pill or IV. Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that relies on the body’s ability to fight infection (immune system). It uses substances made by the body or in a lab to help the immune system work harder or in a more targeted way to fight cancer. This helps your body get rid of cancer cells. Immunotherapy works by: - Stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells - Preventing cancer from spreading to other parts of the body - Boosting the immune system&apos;s ability to get rid of cancer cells These drugs are designed to seek and attack certain parts of a cancer cell. Some have toxins or radioactive substances attached to them. Immunotherapy is given by a shot or IV. Hormonal Therapy Hormone therapy is used to treat cancers that are fueled by hormones, such as breast, prostate, and ovarian cancers. It uses surgery, or drugs to stop or block the body&apos;s natural hormones. This helps slow the growth of cancer cells. The surgery involves removing organs that make hormones: the ovaries or testes. The drugs are given by IV or as pills. Hyperthermia Hyperthermia uses heat to damage and kill cancer cells without harming normal cells. It may be used for: - A small area of cells, such as a tumor - Parts of the body, such as an organ or limb - The whole body The heat is delivered from a machine outside the body or through a needle or probe placed in the tumor. Laser Therapy Laser therapy uses a very narrow, focused beam of light to destroy cancer cells. Laser therapy can be used to: - Destroy tumors and precancerous growths - Shrink tumors that are blocking the stomach, colon, or esophagus - Help treat cancer symptoms, such as bleeding - Seal nerve endings after surgery to reduce pain - Seal lymph vessels after surgery to reduce swelling and keep tumor cells from spreading Laser therapy is often given through a thin, lighted tube that is put inside the body. Thin fibers at the end of the tube direct the light at the cancer cells. Lasers are also used on the skin. Lasers are most often used with other types of cancer treatment such as radiation and chemotherapy. Photodynamic Therapy In photodynamic therapy, a person gets a shot of a drug that is sensitive to a special type of light. The drug stays in cancer cells longer than it stays in healthy cells. Then, the doctor directs light from a laser or other source at the cancer cells. The light changes the drug to a substance that kills the cancer cells. Cryotherapy Also called cryosurgery, this therapy uses very cold gas to freeze and kill cancer cells. It is sometimes used to treat cells that might turn into cancer (called pre-cancerous cells) on the skin or cervix, for example. Doctors can also used a special instrument to deliver cryotherapy to tumors inside the body, such as the liver or prostate.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ovarian cancer (Diagnosis): Tests and procedures used to diagnose ovarian cancer include: - Pelvic exam. During a pelvic exam, your doctor inserts gloved fingers into your vagina and simultaneously presses a hand on your abdomen in order to feel (palpate) your pelvic organs. The doctor also visually examines your external genitalia, vagina and cervix. - Imaging tests. Tests, such as ultrasound or CT scans of your abdomen and pelvis, may help determine the size, shape and structure of your ovaries. - Blood tests. Blood tests might include organ function tests that can help determine your overall health. Your doctor might also test your blood for tumor markers that indicate ovarian cancer. For example, a cancer antigen (CA) 125 test can detect a protein that&apos;s often found on the surface of ovarian cancer cells. These tests can&apos;t tell your doctor whether you have cancer, but may give clues about your diagnosis and prognosis. - Surgery. Sometimes your doctor can&apos;t be certain of your diagnosis until you undergo surgery to remove an ovary and have it tested for signs of cancer. Once it&apos;s confirmed that you have ovarian cancer, your doctor will use information from your tests and procedures to assign your cancer a stage. The stages of ovarian cancer are indicated using Roman numerals ranging from I to IV, with the lowest stage indicating that the cancer is confined to the ovaries. By stage IV, the cancer has spread to distant areas of the body.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>How to diagnose Ovarian cancer?: A physical exam is often normal. With advanced ovarian cancer, the doctor may find a swollen abdomen often due to accumulation of fluid (ascites). A pelvic examination may reveal an ovarian or abdominal mass. A CA-125 blood test is not considered a good screening test for ovarian cancer. But, it may be done if a woman has: - Symptoms of ovarian cancer - Already been diagnosed with ovarian cancer to determine how well treatment is working Other tests that may be done include: - Complete blood count and blood chemistry - Pregnancy test (serum HCG) - CT or MRI of the pelvis or abdomen - Ultrasound of the pelvis Surgery, such as a pelvic laparoscopy or exploratory laparotomy, is often done to find the cause of symptoms. A biopsy will be done to help make the diagnosis. No lab or imaging test has ever been shown to be able to successfully screen for or diagnose ovarian cancer in its early stages, so no standard screening tests are recommended at this time.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ovarian cancer: Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the ovaries. The female reproductive system contains two ovaries, one on each side of the uterus. The ovaries - each about the size of an almond - produce eggs (ova) as well as the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Ovarian cancer often goes undetected until it has spread within the pelvis and abdomen. At this late stage, ovarian cancer is more difficult to treat and is frequently fatal. Early-stage ovarian cancer, in which the disease is confined to the ovary, is more likely to be treated successfully. Surgery and chemotherapy are generally used to treat ovarian cancer. Early-stage ovarian cancer rarely causes any symptoms. Advanced-stage ovarian cancer may cause few and nonspecific symptoms that are often mistaken for more common benign conditions. Signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer may include: - Abdominal bloating or swelling - Quickly feeling full when eating - Weight loss - Discomfort in the pelvis area - Changes in bowel habits, such as constipation - A frequent need to urinate When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms that worry you. If you have a family history of ovarian cancer or breast cancer, talk to your doctor about your risk of ovarian cancer. Your doctor may refer you to a genetic counselor to discuss testing for certain gene mutations that increase your risk of breast and ovarian cancers. It&apos;s not clear what causes ovarian cancer, though doctors have identified factors that can increase the risk of the disease. In general, cancer begins when a cell develops errors (mutations) in its DNA. The mutations tell the cell to grow and multiply quickly, creating a mass (tumor) of abnormal cells. The abnormal cells continue living when healthy cells would die. They can invade nearby tissues and break off from an initial tumor to spread elsewhere in the body (metastasize). Types of ovarian cancer The type of cell where the cancer begins determines the type of ovarian cancer you have. Ovarian cancer types include: - Epithelial tumors, which begin in the thin layer of tissue that covers the outside of the ovaries. About 90 percent of ovarian cancers are epithelial tumors. - Stromal tumors, which begin in the ovarian tissue that contains hormone-producing cells. These tumors are usually diagnosed at an earlier stage than other ovarian tumors. About 7 percent of ovarian tumors are stromal. - Germ cell tumors, which begin in the egg-producing cells. These rare ovarian cancers tend to occur in younger women. Factors that can increase your risk of ovarian cancer include: - Older age. Ovarian cancer can occur at any age but is most common in women ages 50 to 60 years. - Inherited gene mutations. A small percentage of ovarian cancers are caused by gene mutations you inherit from your parents. The genes known to increase the risk of ovarian cancer are called breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer gene 2 (BRCA2). These genes also increase the risk of breast cancer. Other gene mutations, including those associated with Lynch syndrome, are known to increase the risk of ovarian cancer. - Family history of ovarian cancer. People with two or more close relatives with ovarian cancer have an increased risk of the disease. - Estrogen hormone replacement therapy, especially with long-term use and in large doses. - Age when menstruation started and ended. Beginning menstruation at an early age or starting menopause at a later age, or both, may increase the risk of ovarian cancer. Tests and procedures used to diagnose ovarian cancer include: - Pelvic exam. During a pelvic exam, your doctor inserts gloved fingers into your vagina and simultaneously presses a hand on your abdomen in order to feel (palpate) your pelvic organs. The doctor also visually examines your external genitalia, vagina and cervix. - Imaging tests. Tests, such as ultrasound or CT scans of your abdomen and pelvis, may help determine the size, shape and structure of your ovaries. - Blood tests. Blood tests might include organ function tests that can help determine your overall health. Your doctor might also test your blood for tumor markers that indicate ovarian cancer. For example, a cancer antigen (CA) 125 test can detect a protein that&apos;s often found on the surface of ovarian cancer cells. These tests can&apos;t tell your doctor whether you have cancer, but may give clues about your diagnosis and prognosis. - Surgery. Sometimes your doctor can&apos;t be certain of your diagnosis until you undergo surgery to remove an ovary and have it tested for signs of cancer. Once it&apos;s confirmed that you have ovarian cancer, your doctor will use information from your tests and procedures to assign your cancer a stage. The stages of ovarian cancer are indicated using Roman numerals ranging from I to IV, with the lowest stage indicating that the cancer is confined to the ovaries. By stage IV, the cancer has spread to distant areas of the body. Treatment of ovarian cancer usually involves a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Surgery Operations to remove ovarian cancer include: - Surgery to remove one ovary. For very early stage cancer that hasn&apos;t spread beyond one ovary, surgery may involve removing the affected ovary and its fallopian tube. This procedure may preserve your ability to have children. - Surgery to remove both ovaries. If cancer is present in both your ovaries, but there are no signs of additional cancer, your surgeon may remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes. This procedure leaves your uterus intact, so you may still be able to become pregnant using your own frozen embryos or eggs or with eggs from a donor. - Surgery to remove both ovaries and the uterus. If your cancer is more extensive or if you don&apos;t wish to preserve your ability to have children, your surgeon will remove the ovaries, the fallopian tubes, the uterus, nearby lymph nodes and a fold of fatty abdominal tissue (omentum). - Surgery for advanced cancer. If your cancer is advanced, your doctor may recommend chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that uses chemicals to kill fast-growing cells in the body, including cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs can be injected into a vein or taken by mouth. Sometimes the drugs are injected directly into the abdomen (intraperitoneal chemotherapy). Chemotherapy is often used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that might remain. It can also be used before surgery. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy uses medications that target the specific vulnerabilities present within your cancer cells. Targeted therapy drugs are usually reserved for treating ovarian cancer that returns after initial treatment or cancer that resists other treatments. Your doctor may test your cancer cells to determine which targeted therapy is most likely to have an effect on your cancer. Targeted therapy is an active area of cancer research. Many clinical trials are testing new targeted therapies. Supportive (palliative) care Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care. Palliative care can be used while undergoing other aggressive treatments, such as surgery and chemotherapy. When palliative care is used along with all of the other appropriate treatments, people with cancer may feel better and live longer. Palliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. Palliative care teams aim to improve the quality of life for people with cancer and their families. This form of care is offered alongside curative or other treatments you may be receiving.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Ovarian cancer: Ovarian cancer is cancer that begins in the ovaries. The ovaries make female hormones and produce a woman&apos;s eggs. Ovarian cancer is a serious cancer that is more common in older women. Treatment is most effective when the cancer is found early. Screening for ovarian cancer is not recommended for most women. Learn more about ovarian cancer at the National Cancer Institute. Ovarian cancer forms in tissues of the ovary. (An ovary is one of a pair of female reproductive glands in which the ova, or eggs, are formed.) Tumors in the ovaries can be benign, which means they are not cancer, or they can be malignant, which means they are cancer. Cancers that start in the ovaries can spread to other parts of the body. This is called metastasis. Cancer that starts in the ovaries and spreads to other parts of the body is still called ovarian cancer. Around one in every 60 women in the United States will develop ovarian cancer. Most ovarian cancers are diagnosed in women over 60, but this disease can also affect younger women. Among women in the United States, ovarian cancer is rare. Most ovarian cancers are diagnosed among women ages 55 to 64, but ovarian cancer can also affect younger women. Women with a high risk of ovarian cancer are those with a harmful mutation on the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. These mutations can be found with a blood test. Women with a family or personal history of breast or ovarian cancer also have a higher risk of ovarian cancer. If you have family members in multiple generations with breast cancer or ovarian cancer, see your doctor to learn more about your risk of ovarian cancer. Research shows that certain steps, such as surgery to remove the ovaries and the fallopian tubes, may help prevent ovarian cancer in women who are at high risk. The sooner ovarian cancer is found and treated, the better your chance for recovery. But ovarian cancer is hard to detect early, because its symptoms are also the symptoms of many other illnesses. The following may be symptoms of ovarian cancer if they continue or get worse over time: If you have any of these symptoms, talk to your doctor. He or she can determine if the cause is cancer or something else. Your doctor also may ask you to visit a gynecologic oncologist. This is a doctor who focuses on cancers of the female pelvis. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against screening women who are not at high risk for ovarian cancer. The USPSTF found that testing for ovarian cancer may do more harm than good. Current testing methods, like pelvic exams, ultrasound, and blood tests, can lead to &quot;false positives&quot; (results that say a woman has ovarian cancer when she really does not have ovarian cancer). These incorrect results can lead to surgeries that are not needed and that can be risky. Some women, like those who are at high risk, can talk to their doctor about their risk and what they can do to help prevent ovarian cancer.

				<AnswerText>Cryotherapy for prostate cancer: Cryotherapy uses very cold temperatures to freeze and kill prostate cancer cells. The goal of cryosurgery is to destroy the entire prostate gland and possibly surrounding tissue. Cryosurgery is generally not used as a first treatment for prostate cancer. Before the procedure, you will be given medicine so that you do not feel pain. You may receive: - A sedative to make you drowsy and numbing medicine on your perineum. This is the area between the anus and scrotum. - Anesthesia. With spinal anesthesia, you will be drowsy but awake, and numb below the waist. With general anesthesia, you will be asleep and pain-free. First, you will get a catheter that will stay in place for about 3 weeks after the procedure. Then, the doctor makes small cuts to place several hollow needles into your perineum. - Ultrasound is used to guide the needles to the prostate gland. - Then, very cold gas passes through the needles, creating ice balls that destroy the prostate gland. - Warm salt water will flow through the catheter to keep your urethra (the tube from the bladder to outside the body) from freezing. Cryosurgery is most often a 2-hour outpatient procedure. Some people may need to stay in the hospital overnight. This therapy is not as commonly used and is not as well accepted as other treatments for prostate cancer. Doctors do not know for certain how well cryosurgery works over time. There is not enough data to compare it with standard prostatectomy, radiation treatment, or brachytherapy. It can only treat prostate cancer that has not spread beyond the prostate. Men who cannot have surgery because of their age or other health problems may have cryosurgery instead. It also may be used if cancer comes back after other treatments. It is generally not helpful for men with very large prostate glands. Possible short-term side effects of cryotherapy for prostate cancer include: - Blood in the urine - Trouble passing urine - Swelling of the penis or scrotum - Problems controlling your bladder (more likely if you have had radiation therapy also) Possible long-term problems include: - Erection problems in nearly all people - Damage to the rectum - A tube that forms between the rectum and the bladder, called a fistula (this is very rare) - Problems with passing or controlling urine.

				<AnswerText>Prostate cancer: Prostate cancer is cancer that occurs in the prostate - a small walnut-shaped gland in men that produces the seminal fluid that nourishes and transports sperm. Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in men. Usually prostate cancer grows slowly and is initially confined to the prostate gland, where it may not cause serious harm. However, while some types of prostate cancer grow slowly and may need minimal or even no treatment, other types are aggressive and can spread quickly. Prostate cancer that&apos;s detected early - when it&apos;s still confined to the prostate gland- has a better chance of successful treatment. Prostate cancer care at Mayo Clinic Prostate cancer may cause no signs or symptoms in its early stages. Prostate cancer that&apos;s more advanced may cause signs and symptoms such as: - Trouble urinating - Decreased force in the stream of urine - Blood in semen - Discomfort in the pelvic area - Bone pain - Erectile dysfunction When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms that worry you. Debate continues regarding the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening, and medical organizations differ on their recommendations. Discuss prostate cancer screening with your doctor. Together, you can decide what&apos;s best for you. It&apos;s not clear what causes prostate cancer. Doctors know that prostate cancer begins when some cells in your prostate become abnormal. Mutations in the abnormal cells&apos; DNA cause the cells to grow and divide more rapidly than normal cells do. The abnormal cells continue living, when other cells would die. The accumulating abnormal cells form a tumor that can grow to invade nearby tissue. Some abnormal cells can also break off and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. Factors that can increase your risk of prostate cancer include: - Age. Your risk of prostate cancer increases as you age. - Race. For reasons not yet determined, black men carry a greater risk of prostate cancer than do men of other races. In black men, prostate cancer is also more likely to be aggressive or advanced. - Family history. If men in your family have had prostate cancer, your risk may be increased. Also, if you have a family history of genes that increase the risk of breast cancer (BRCA1 or BRCA2) or a very strong family history of breast cancer, your risk of prostate cancer may be higher. - Obesity. Obese men diagnosed with prostate cancer may be more likely to have advanced disease that&apos;s more difficult to treat. Complications of prostate cancer and its treatments include: - Cancer that spreads (metastasizes). Prostate cancer can spread to nearby organs, such as your bladder, or travel through your bloodstream or lymphatic system to your bones or other organs. Prostate cancer that spreads to the bones can cause pain and broken bones. Once prostate cancer has spread to other areas of the body, it may still respond to treatment and may be controlled, but it&apos;s unlikely to be cured. - Incontinence. Both prostate cancer and its treatment can cause urinary incontinence. Treatment for incontinence depends on the type you have, how severe it is and the likelihood it will improve over time. Treatment options may include medications, catheters and surgery. - Erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction can result from prostate cancer or its treatment, including surgery, radiation or hormone treatments. Medications, vacuum devices that assist in achieving erection and surgery are available to treat erectile dysfunction. Screening for prostate cancer Whether to test healthy men with no symptoms for prostate cancer is controversial. Medical organizations don&apos;t agree on the issue of screening and whether it delivers benefits. Some medical organizations recommend men consider prostate cancer screening in their 50s, or sooner for men who have risk factors for prostate cancer. Discuss your particular situation and the benefits and risks of screening with your doctor. Together, you can decide whether prostate cancer screening is right for you. Prostate screening tests might include: - Digital rectal exam (DRE). During a DRE, your doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to examine your prostate, which is adjacent to the rectum. If your doctor finds any abnormalities in the texture, shape or size of the gland, you may need further tests. - Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. A blood sample is drawn from a vein in your arm and analyzed for PSA, a substance that&apos;s naturally produced by your prostate gland. It&apos;s normal for a small amount of PSA to be in your bloodstream. However, if a higher than normal level is found, it may indicate prostate infection, inflammation, enlargement or cancer. PSA testing combined with DRE helps identify prostate cancers at their earliest stages. Hence, debate continues surrounding prostate cancer screening. Diagnosing prostate cancer If a DRE or PSA test detects an abnormality, your doctor may recommend further tests to determine whether you have prostate cancer, such as: - Ultrasound. If other tests raise concerns, your doctor may use transrectal ultrasound to further evaluate your prostate. A small probe, about the size and shape of a cigar, is inserted into your rectum. The probe uses sound waves to create a picture of your prostate gland. - Collecting a sample of prostate tissue. If initial test results suggest prostate cancer, your doctor may recommend a procedure to collect a sample of cells from your prostate (prostate biopsy). Prostate biopsy is often done using a thin needle that&apos;s inserted into the prostate to collect tissue. The tissue sample is analyzed in a lab to determine whether cancer cells are present. - MRI fusion. While still being developed worldwide, MRI fusion to assist in prostate biopsy and diagnosis is being used more and more. At Mayo Clinic, urologists and radiologists collaborate to leverage MRI fusion biopsy technology, yielding the best fusion imaging available for prostate cancer care. Mayo Clinic also leverages MRI-TRUS fusion technology, which blends (fuses) images from an MRI scan and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) to create a more-precise 360-degree prostate map, which in turn can improve prostate biopsy accuracy. Mayo Clinic is also the first medical center in the United States approved by the Food and Drug Administration to prepare and administer C-11 choline PET scanning to help detect recurrent prostate cancer at its earliest stages - before it can be detected by other imaging tests - and enable more-precise targeting for follow-up treatment. Determining whether prostate cancer is aggressive When a biopsy confirms the presence of cancer, the next step is to determine the level of aggressiveness (grade) of the cancer cells. A laboratory pathologist examines a sample of your cancer to determine how much cancer cells differ from the healthy cells. A higher grade indicates a more aggressive cancer that is more likely to spread quickly. The most common scale used to evaluate the grade of prostate cancer cells is called a Gleason score. Gleason scoring combines two numbers and can range from 2 (nonaggressive cancer) to 10 (very aggressive cancer). In addition, genomic testing in increasingly being used to more accurately assess risk and detect aggressive prostate cancer. Mayo Clinic physicians and researchers are leaders in the development of biomarkers for prostate cancer. Doctors in Mayo Clinic&apos;s Center for Individualized Medicine are advancing research on the use of biomarkers in blood and in prostate tissue to better individualize and optimize treatment for men with prostate cancer. The technology helps caregivers distinguish between insignificant and significant prostate cancer, as well as identify particularly aggressive prostate cancer in men undergoing surgery. Determining how far the cancer has spread Once a prostate cancer diagnosis has been made, your doctor works to determine the extent (stage) of the cancer. If your doctor suspects your cancer may have spread beyond your prostate, one or more of the following imaging tests may be recommended: - Bone scan - Ultrasound - Computerized tomography (CT) scan - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - Positron emission tomography (PET) scan At Mayo Clinic, caregivers can also turn to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) studies to help detect the extent of newly diagnosed prostate cancer and whether the disease has spread to nearby lymph nodes. Mayo clinicians also use recent 7 Tesla (7T) magnet imaging technology advancements to differentiate between prostate cancer that does or doesn&apos;t require immediate intervention. Not every person should have every test. Your doctor will help determine which tests are best for your individual case. Your doctor uses the information from these tests to assign your cancer a stage. Prostate cancer stages are indicated by Roman numerals ranging from I to IV. The lowest stages indicate the cancer is confined to the prostate. By stage IV, the cancer has grown beyond the prostate and may have spread to other areas of the body. The cancer staging system continues to evolve and is becoming more complex as doctors improve cancer diagnosis and treatment. Your doctor uses your cancer stage to select the treatments that are right for you. Your prostate cancer treatment options depend on several factors, such as how fast your cancer is growing, how much it has spread and your overall health, as well as the potential benefits or side effects of the treatment. Immediate treatment may not be necessary For men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer, treatment may not be necessary right away. Some men may never need treatment. Instead, doctors sometimes recommend active surveillance. In active surveillance, regular follow-up blood tests, rectal exams and possibly biopsies may be performed to monitor progression of your cancer. If tests show your cancer is progressing, you may opt for a prostate cancer treatment such as surgery or radiation. Active surveillance may be an option for cancer that isn&apos;t causing symptoms, is expected to grow very slowly and is confined to a small area of the prostate. Active surveillance may also be considered for someone who has another serious health condition or who is of an advanced age that makes cancer treatment more difficult. Active surveillance carries a risk that the cancer may grow and spread between checkups, making the cancer less likely to be cured. Surgery to remove the prostate Surgery for prostate cancer involves removing the prostate gland (radical prostatectomy), some surrounding tissue and a few lymph nodes. Radical prostatectomy can be performed in several ways: - Using a robot to assist with surgery. During robot-assisted surgery, the instruments are attached to a mechanical device (robot) and inserted into your abdomen through several small incisions. The surgeon sits at a console and uses hand controls to guide the robot to move the instruments. Robotic prostatectomy may allow the surgeon to make more-precise movements with surgical tools than is possible with traditional minimally invasive surgery. - Making an incision in your abdomen. During retropubic surgery, the prostate gland is taken out through an incision in your lower abdomen. Discuss with your doctor which type of surgery is best for your specific situation. Radical prostatectomy carries a risk of urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Ask your doctor to explain the risks you may face based on your situation, the type of procedure you select, your age, your body type and your overall health. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses high-powered energy to kill cancer cells. Prostate cancer radiation therapy can be delivered in two ways: - Radiation that comes from outside of your body (external beam radiation). During external beam radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a machine moves around your body, directing high-powered energy beams, such as X-rays or protons, to your prostate cancer. You typically undergo external beam radiation treatments five days a week for several weeks. - Radiation placed inside your body (brachytherapy). Brachytherapy involves placing many rice-sized radioactive seeds in your prostate tissue. The radioactive seeds deliver a low dose of radiation over a long period of time. Your doctor implants the radioactive seeds in your prostate using a needle guided by ultrasound images. The implanted seeds eventually stop emitting radiation and don&apos;t need to be removed. Side effects of radiation therapy can include painful, frequent or urgent urination, as well as rectal symptoms such as loose stools or pain when passing stools. Erectile dysfunction can also occur. Hormone therapy Hormone therapy is treatment to stop your body from producing the male hormone testosterone. Prostate cancer cells rely on testosterone to help them grow. Cutting off the supply of testosterone may cause cancer cells to die or to grow more slowly. Hormone therapy options include: - Medications that stop your body from producing testosterone. Medications known as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonists prevent the testicles from receiving messages to make testosterone. Drugs typically used in this type of hormone therapy include leuprolide (Lupron, Eligard), goserelin (Zoladex), triptorelin (Trelstar) and histrelin (Vantas). Other drugs sometimes used include ketoconazole and abiraterone (Zytiga). - Medications that block testosterone from reaching cancer cells. Medications known as anti-androgens prevent testosterone from reaching your cancer cells. Examples include bicalutamide (Casodex), nilutamide (Nilandron) and flutamide. The drug enzalutamide (Xtandi) may be an option when other hormone therapies are no longer effective. - Surgery to remove the testicles (orchiectomy). Removing your testicles reduces testosterone levels in your body. Hormone therapy is used in men with advanced prostate cancer to shrink the cancer and slow the growth of tumors. In men with early-stage prostate cancer, hormone therapy may be used to shrink tumors before radiation therapy, which can increase the likelihood that radiation therapy will be successful. Side effects of hormone therapy may include erectile dysfunction, hot flashes, loss of bone mass, reduced sex drive and weight gain. Freezing prostate tissue Cryosurgery or cryoablation involves freezing tissue to kill cancer cells. During cryosurgery for prostate cancer, small needles are inserted in the prostate using ultrasound images as guidance. A very cold gas is placed in the needles, which causes the surrounding tissue to freeze. A second gas is then placed in the needles to reheat the tissue. The cycles of freezing and thawing kill the cancer cells and some surrounding healthy tissue. Initial attempts to use cryosurgery for prostate cancer resulted in high complication rates and unacceptable side effects. However, newer technologies have lowered complication rates, improved cancer control and made the procedure easier to tolerate. Cryosurgery is more frequently used as a salvage therapy for men who haven&apos;t been helped by radiation therapy. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill rapidly growing cells, including cancer cells. Chemotherapy can be administered through a vein in your arm, in pill form or both. Chemotherapy may be a treatment option for men with prostate cancer that has spread to remote body locations. Chemotherapy may also be an option for cancers that don&apos;t respond to hormone therapy. Biological therapy Biological therapy (immunotherapy) uses your body&apos;s immune system to fight cancer cells. One type of biological therapy called sipuleucel-T (Provenge) has been developed to treat advanced, recurrent prostate cancer. This treatment takes some of your own immune cells, genetically engineers them in a laboratory to fight prostate cancer, then injects the cells back into your body through a vein. Some men do respond to this therapy with some improvement in their cancer, but the treatment is very expensive and requires multiple treatments. No complementary or alternative treatments will cure prostate cancer. However, complementary and alternative prostate cancer treatments may help you cope with the side effects of cancer and its treatment. Nearly everyone diagnosed with cancer experiences some distress at some point. If you&apos;re distressed, you may feel sad, angry or anxious. You may experience difficulty sleeping or find yourself constantly thinking about your cancer. Several complementary medicine techniques may help you cope with your distress, including: - Art therapy - Dance or movement therapy - Exercise - Meditation - Music therapy - Relaxation techniques - Spirituality Discuss your feelings and concerns with your doctor. In some cases, treatment for distress may require medications.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Prostate cancer screening: Cancer screenings can help find signs of cancer early, before you notice any symptoms. In many cases, finding cancer early makes it easier to treat or cure. However, at present it is not clear if screening for prostate cancer is helpful for most men. For this reason, you should speak with your health care provider before having a prostate cancer screening. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is a blood test that checks the level of PSA in your blood. - In some cases, a high level of PSA could mean you have prostate cancer. - But other conditions can also cause a high level, such as infection in the prostate or an enlarged prostate. You may need another test to find out if you have cancer. - Other blood tests or a prostate biopsy can help diagnose a cancer if the PSA test is high. Digital rectal exam (DRE) is a test where your provider inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum. This allows the provider to check the prostate for lumps or unusual areas. Unfortunately, most cancers cannot be felt with this type of exam, at least in the early stages. In most cases, the PSA and DRE are done together. Imaging tests such as an ultrasound or an MRI do not do an accurate job of screening for prostate cancer. The benefit of any cancer screening test is to find cancer early, when it easier to treat. But the value of PSA screening for prostate cancer is debated. No single answer fits all men. Prostate cancer often grows very slowly. PSA levels can begin to rise years before a cancer causes any symptoms or problems. It is also very common as men age. In many cases, the cancer will not cause any problems or shorten a man&apos;s life span. For these reasons, it is not clear if the benefits of routine screenings outweigh the risks or side effects of being treated for prostate cancer once it is found. There are other factors to think about before having a PSA test: - Anxiety. Elevated PSA levels do not always mean you have cancer. These results and the need for further testing can cause a lot of fear and anxiety, even if you do not have prostate cancer. - Side effects from further testing. If your PSA test is higher than normal, you may need to have a one or more biopsies to find out for sure. A biopsy is safe but can cause problems such as an infection, pain, fever, or blood in the semen or urine. - Overtreatment. Many prostate cancers will not affect your normal life span. But since it is impossible to know for sure, most people want to get treatment. Cancer treatment can have serious side effects, including problems with erections and urinating. These side effects can cause more problems than the untreated cancer. Measuring the PSA level can increase the chance of finding prostate cancer when it is very early. But there is debate over the value of the PSA test for detecting prostate cancer. No single answer fits all men. Before having the test, talk to your provider about the pros and cons of having a PSA test. Ask about: - Whether screening decreases your chance of dying from prostate cancer. - Whether there is any harm from prostate cancer screening, such as side effects from testing or overtreatment of cancer when discovered. If you choose to be tested, the PSA is most often done every year to screen men: - From ages 55 to 69, if no risk factors are present. - Starting around age 40 to 45 if they have a higher chance of developing prostate cancer. A family history of prostate cancer (especially a brother or father) and being African American are more common risk factors.

				<AnswerText>Prostate cancer staging: Cancer staging is a way to describe how much cancer is in your body and where it is located in your body. Prostate cancer staging helps determine how big your tumor is, whether it has spread, and where it has spread. Knowing the stage of your cancer helps your cancer team: - Decide the best way to treat the cancer - Determine your chance of recovery - Find clinical trials you may be able to join Initial staging is based on the results of PSA blood tests, biopsies, and imaging tests. This is also called clinical staging. PSArefers to a protein made by the prostate measured by a lab test. - A higher level of PSA can indicate a more advanced cancer. - The doctors will also look at how fast the PSA levels have been increasing from test to test. A faster increase could show a more aggressive tumor. A prostate biopsy is done in your doctor&apos;s office. The results can indicate: - How much of the prostate is involved. - The Gleason score. A number from 2 to 10 that shows how closely the cancer cells look like normal cells when viewed under a microscope. Scores less than 6 suggest the cancer is slow growing and not aggressive. Higher numbers indicate a faster growing cancer that is more likely to spread. Imaging tests such as a CT scan, MRI, or Bone scan also may be done. Using the results from these tests, your doctor can tell you your clinical stage. At times, this is enough information to make decisions about your treatment. Surgical staging (pathological staging) is based on what your doctor finds if you have surgery to remove the prostate and perhaps some of the lymph nodes. Lab tests are done on the tissue that&apos;s removed. This staging helps determine what other treatment you may need might. It also helps predict what to expect after treatment ends. The higher the stage, the more advanced the cancer. Stage I cancer. The cancer is found only in only one part of the prostate. Stage I is called localized prostate cancer. It cannot be felt during a digital rectal exam or seen with imaging tests. If the PSA is less than 10 and the Gleason score is 6 or less, Stage I cancer is likely to grow slowly. Stage II cancer. The cancer is more advanced than stage I. It has not spread beyond the prostate and is still called localized. The cells are less normal than cells in stage I, and may grow more rapidly. There are two types of stage II prostate cancer: - Stage IIA is most likely found in only one side of the prostate. - Stage IIB may be found in both sides of the prostate. Stage III cancer. The cancer has spread outside the prostate into local tissue. It may have spread into the seminal vesicles. These are the glands that make semen. Stage III is called locally advanced prostate cancer. Stage IV cancer. The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body. It could be in nearby lymph nodes or bones, most often of the pelvis or spine. Other organs such as bladder, liver, or lungs can be involved. Staging along with the PSA value and Gleason score help you and your doctor decide on the best treatment, taking into account: - Your age - Your overall health - Your symptoms (if you have any) - Your feelings about side effects of treatment - The chance that treatment can cure your cancer or help you in other ways With stage I, II, or III prostate cancer, the main goal is to cure the cancer by treating it and keeping it from coming back. With stage IV, the goal is to improve symptoms and prolong life. In most cases, stage IV prostate cancer cannot be cured.

				<AnswerText>Familial prostate cancer (Summary): Familial prostate cancer is a cluster of prostate cancer within a family. Most cases of prostate cancer occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. However, approximately 5% to 10% of prostate cancer cases are believed to be primarily caused by a genetic predisposition to the condition. [1] In many families, the underlying genetic cause is unknown; however, some of these cases are caused by changes ( mutations ) in the BRCA1 , BRCA2, HOXB13, or several other genes . Other cases are likely due to a combination of gene(s) and other shared factors such as environment and lifestyle.

				<AnswerText>Prostate Cancer (Overview): The prostate gland makes fluid that forms part of semen. The prostate lies just below the bladder in front of the rectum. It surrounds the urethra (the tube that carries urine and semen through the penis and out of the body). Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the United States, after skin cancer. It is the second leading cause of death from cancer in men. Prostate cancer occurs more often in African-American men than in white men. African-American men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than white men with prostate cancer. Almost all prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas (cancers that begin in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids). Prostate cancer often has no early symptoms. Advanced prostate cancer can cause men to urinate more often or have a weaker flow of urine, but these symptoms can also be caused by benign prostate conditions. Prostate cancer usually grows very slowly. Most men with prostate cancer are older than 65 years and do not die from the disease. Finding and treating prostate cancer before symptoms occur may not improve health or help you live longer. Talk to your doctor about your risk of prostate cancer and whether you need screening tests.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Familial prostate cancer: Familial prostate cancer is a cluster of prostate cancer within a family. Most cases of prostate cancer occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. However, approximately 5% to 10% of prostate cancer cases are believed to be primarily caused by a genetic predisposition to the condition. [1] In many families, the underlying genetic cause is unknown; however, some of these cases are caused by changes ( mutations ) in the BRCA1 , BRCA2, HOXB13, or several other genes . Other cases are likely due to a combination of gene(s) and other shared factors such as environment and lifestyle. [2] High-risk cancer screening at an earlier age is typically recommended in men who have an increased risk for prostate cancer based on personal and/or family histories. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency).

				<AnswerText>Cryotherapy for prostate cancer (When Cryosurgery is Used to Treat Prostate Cancer): This therapy is not as commonly used and is not as well accepted as other treatments for prostate cancer. Doctors do not know for certain how well cryosurgery works over time. There is not enough data to compare it with standard prostatectomy, radiation treatment, or brachytherapy. It can only treat prostate cancer that has not spread beyond the prostate. Men who cannot have surgery because of their age or other health problems may have cryosurgery instead. It also may be used if cancer comes back after other treatments. It is generally not helpful for men with very large prostate glands.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Prostate cancer (Treatment): Your prostate cancer treatment options depend on several factors, such as how fast your cancer is growing, how much it has spread and your overall health, as well as the potential benefits or side effects of the treatment. Immediate treatment may not be necessary For men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer, treatment may not be necessary right away. Some men may never need treatment. Instead, doctors sometimes recommend active surveillance. In active surveillance, regular follow-up blood tests, rectal exams and possibly biopsies may be performed to monitor progression of your cancer. If tests show your cancer is progressing, you may opt for a prostate cancer treatment such as surgery or radiation. Active surveillance may be an option for cancer that isn&apos;t causing symptoms, is expected to grow very slowly and is confined to a small area of the prostate. Active surveillance may also be considered for someone who has another serious health condition or who is of an advanced age that makes cancer treatment more difficult. Active surveillance carries a risk that the cancer may grow and spread between checkups, making the cancer less likely to be cured. Surgery to remove the prostate Surgery for prostate cancer involves removing the prostate gland (radical prostatectomy), some surrounding tissue and a few lymph nodes. Radical prostatectomy can be performed in several ways: - Using a robot to assist with surgery. During robot-assisted surgery, the instruments are attached to a mechanical device (robot) and inserted into your abdomen through several small incisions. The surgeon sits at a console and uses hand controls to guide the robot to move the instruments. Robotic prostatectomy may allow the surgeon to make more-precise movements with surgical tools than is possible with traditional minimally invasive surgery. - Making an incision in your abdomen. During retropubic surgery, the prostate gland is taken out through an incision in your lower abdomen. Discuss with your doctor which type of surgery is best for your specific situation. Radical prostatectomy carries a risk of urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Ask your doctor to explain the risks you may face based on your situation, the type of procedure you select, your age, your body type and your overall health. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses high-powered energy to kill cancer cells. Prostate cancer radiation therapy can be delivered in two ways: - Radiation that comes from outside of your body (external beam radiation). During external beam radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a machine moves around your body, directing high-powered energy beams, such as X-rays or protons, to your prostate cancer. You typically undergo external beam radiation treatments five days a week for several weeks. - Radiation placed inside your body (brachytherapy). Brachytherapy involves placing many rice-sized radioactive seeds in your prostate tissue. The radioactive seeds deliver a low dose of radiation over a long period of time. Your doctor implants the radioactive seeds in your prostate using a needle guided by ultrasound images. The implanted seeds eventually stop emitting radiation and don&apos;t need to be removed. Side effects of radiation therapy can include painful, frequent or urgent urination, as well as rectal symptoms such as loose stools or pain when passing stools. Erectile dysfunction can also occur. Hormone therapy Hormone therapy is treatment to stop your body from producing the male hormone testosterone. Prostate cancer cells rely on testosterone to help them grow. Cutting off the supply of testosterone may cause cancer cells to die or to grow more slowly. Hormone therapy options include: - Medications that stop your body from producing testosterone. Medications known as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonists prevent the testicles from receiving messages to make testosterone. Drugs typically used in this type of hormone therapy include leuprolide (Lupron, Eligard), goserelin (Zoladex), triptorelin (Trelstar) and histrelin (Vantas). Other drugs sometimes used include ketoconazole and abiraterone (Zytiga). - Medications that block testosterone from reaching cancer cells. Medications known as anti-androgens prevent testosterone from reaching your cancer cells. Examples include bicalutamide (Casodex), nilutamide (Nilandron) and flutamide. The drug enzalutamide (Xtandi) may be an option when other hormone therapies are no longer effective. - Surgery to remove the testicles (orchiectomy). Removing your testicles reduces testosterone levels in your body. Hormone therapy is used in men with advanced prostate cancer to shrink the cancer and slow the growth of tumors. In men with early-stage prostate cancer, hormone therapy may be used to shrink tumors before radiation therapy, which can increase the likelihood that radiation therapy will be successful. Side effects of hormone therapy may include erectile dysfunction, hot flashes, loss of bone mass, reduced sex drive and weight gain. Freezing prostate tissue Cryosurgery or cryoablation involves freezing tissue to kill cancer cells. During cryosurgery for prostate cancer, small needles are inserted in the prostate using ultrasound images as guidance. A very cold gas is placed in the needles, which causes the surrounding tissue to freeze. A second gas is then placed in the needles to reheat the tissue. The cycles of freezing and thawing kill the cancer cells and some surrounding healthy tissue. Initial attempts to use cryosurgery for prostate cancer resulted in high complication rates and unacceptable side effects. However, newer technologies have lowered complication rates, improved cancer control and made the procedure easier to tolerate. Cryosurgery is more frequently used as a salvage therapy for men who haven&apos;t been helped by radiation therapy. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill rapidly growing cells, including cancer cells. Chemotherapy can be administered through a vein in your arm, in pill form or both. Chemotherapy may be a treatment option for men with prostate cancer that has spread to remote body locations. Chemotherapy may also be an option for cancers that don&apos;t respond to hormone therapy. Biological therapy Biological therapy (immunotherapy) uses your body&apos;s immune system to fight cancer cells. One type of biological therapy called sipuleucel-T (Provenge) has been developed to treat advanced, recurrent prostate cancer. This treatment takes some of your own immune cells, genetically engineers them in a laboratory to fight prostate cancer, then injects the cells back into your body through a vein. Some men do respond to this therapy with some improvement in their cancer, but the treatment is very expensive and requires multiple treatments.</AnswerText>

				<AnswerText>Cryotherapy for prostate cancer: Cryotherapy uses very cold temperatures to freeze and kill prostate cancer cells. The goal of cryosurgery is to destroy the entire prostate gland and possibly surrounding tissue. Cryosurgery is generally not used as a first treatment for prostate cancer. Before the procedure, you will be given medicine so that you do not feel pain. You may receive: - A sedative to make you drowsy and numbing medicine on your perineum. This is the area between the anus and scrotum. - Anesthesia. With spinal anesthesia, you will be drowsy but awake, and numb below the waist. With general anesthesia, you will be asleep and pain-free. First, you will get a catheter that will stay in place for about 3 weeks after the procedure. Then, the doctor makes small cuts to place several hollow needles into your perineum. - Ultrasound is used to guide the needles to the prostate gland. - Then, very cold gas passes through the needles, creating ice balls that destroy the prostate gland. - Warm salt water will flow through the catheter to keep your urethra (the tube from the bladder to outside the body) from freezing. Cryosurgery is most often a 2-hour outpatient procedure. Some people may need to stay in the hospital overnight. This therapy is not as commonly used and is not as well accepted as other treatments for prostate cancer. Doctors do not know for certain how well cryosurgery works over time. There is not enough data to compare it with standard prostatectomy, radiation treatment, or brachytherapy. It can only treat prostate cancer that has not spread beyond the prostate. Men who cannot have surgery because of their age or other health problems may have cryosurgery instead. It also may be used if cancer comes back after other treatments. It is generally not helpful for men with very large prostate glands. Possible short-term side effects of cryotherapy for prostate cancer include: - Blood in the urine - Trouble passing urine - Swelling of the penis or scrotum - Problems controlling your bladder (more likely if you have had radiation therapy also) Possible long-term problems include: - Erection problems in nearly all people - Damage to the rectum - A tube that forms between the rectum and the bladder, called a fistula (this is very rare) - Problems with passing or controlling urine.
